Korea Zinc Inc. is accelerating its artificial intelligence(AI)-driven smelter transition with a new dedicated team and specialized AI training for employees.
The company said Tuesday it formed an AI strategy team earlier this month under its growth-focused technology headquarters. Comprised of information technology and data experts, the team will work with the Onsan Smelter innovation unit to improve operations through AI-based facility diagnostics and process optimization.
Korea Zinc signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) on Monday to strengthen company-wide AI capabilities.
Beginning September 2, about 300 employees will take part in a four-month training program covering AI fundamentals, industrial application case studies, and project-based exercises using real process data.
The partnership will also extend to technical consulting, joint research on AI and smart manufacturing, continuous talent development, organizational culture improvements for AI integration, and strategic cooperation in technology commercialization.
“For a smart smelter to succeed, employees must have a strong understanding of AI and the ability to apply it in practice,” a company official said. “We aim to strengthen data-driven management and foster a technology-centered corporate culture.”
The company has also deployed Boston Dynamics Inc.’s four-legged walking robot Spot at the Onsan Smelter, the first such use globally, to enhance on-site safety and operational efficiency.
