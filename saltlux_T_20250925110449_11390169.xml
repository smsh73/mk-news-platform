Samsung Electronics Co.’s advanced foundry plant that is currently under construction in Taylor, Texas, is attracting strong interest from big global tech companies.
Industry sources said Friday the project is more than 90 percent complete and is scheduled to begin full-scale mass production in early 2026. The $37 billion plant, often referred to as the “Taylor fab,” will be Samsung’s second foundry in the United States. While the existing Austin plant produces mid- to low-end semiconductors using previous-generation technology, the Taylor fab will focus on high-performance chips manufactured with advanced gate-all-around (GAA) processes of 4 nanometers and below. Its technology is expected to rival Fab 21, which Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is currently building in Arizona.
Tesla Inc. was the first major client to commit, announcing plans to produce autonomous driving artificial intelligence (AI) chips at the site. Qualcomm Inc., Samsung’s long-time foundry partner, is also showing interest. Qualcomm used Samsung to produce its flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 application processor (AP) in 2022 but later shifted production to TSMC due to yield and power efficiency issues. Industry analysts say that if Samsung’s second-generation 3-nanometer GAA process stabilizes and yields improve, Qualcomm may resume outsourcing some high-end chip production to the Taylor fab.
Google LLC is also a potential customer. The company has entrusted production of its in-house Tensor processors, used in Pixel smartphones, to Samsung’s 5-nanometer and 4-nanometer processes for the G1 through G3 chips. Ongoing concerns over overheating and battery drain have fueled speculation that the upcoming G5 chip would be manufactured by TSMC, but a stable launch at Taylor could prompt Google to continue its collaboration with Samsung.
Apple Inc.’s position remains uncertain., Apple split some A-series iPhone chip production between Samsung and TSMC until 2015 before moving exclusively to TSMC, citing the challenges of relying on a direct competitor for core chip manufacturing. The mounting supply chain diversification pressures and geopolitical risks in Taiwan and delays at TSMC’s Arizona facility have made securing alternative U.S. production capacity more urgent, positioning the Taylor fab as a candidate for non-core chip production.
On Thursday, Apple agreed to produce iPhone image sensors at Samsung’s Austin plant, a move that carries lower competitive risk because image sensors are not main processor chips. If cooperation extends to other components such as power management integrated circuits (PMICs), touch controllers, and communications sub-chips like Bluetooth and ultra-wideband (UWB), the Taylor facility could take on a more central role.
The plant also holds strategic value for U.S. industrial policy. Amid the government’s push to expand advanced manufacturing capacity domestically, the Taylor fab could position Samsung as a strategic partner in U.S.-led production of defense, space, and AI chips. “The success or failure of Samsung’s foundry strategy over the next decade may depend on the Taylor facility,” an industry insider said.
