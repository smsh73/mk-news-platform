BlueOval SK, the electric vehicle battery joint venture between South Korea’s SK On and U.S. Ford Motor, began its first commercial production.
Industry sources said on Wednesday that BlueOval SK started shipping batteries on August 19th, 2025, from its Glendale, Kentucky Plant 1, which has an annual capacity of 37 gigawatt-hours. The plant will supply batteries for Ford’s F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck and the E-Transit electric cargo van, as well as producing batteries for future Ford and Lincoln EV models moving forward.
The company, which employs around 1,450 people, plans to soon hold a ceremony to mark the start of commercial production at the Kentucky facility before entering full-scale operations.
SK On and Ford formed BlueOval SK in July 2022 with a $11.4 billion investment to build three battery plants in Glendale, Kentucky, and Stanton, Tennessee. The company said it will determine the launch timelines for the second Kentucky plant and the Tennessee plant based on overall market demand.
The move comes as localization has become increasingly important under the tariff policies of the U.S.’ Donald Trump administration. With the start of operations at Kentucky Plant 1, SK On is set to strengthen its U.S. production capacity even further. Its wholly owned subsidiary, SK Battery America (SKBA), located in Georgia, began production in 2022, and recently ramped up all battery cell production lines, which is serving as a key driver of SK On’s growth in North America.
With the additional U.S. facility, SK On will be able to respond to battery demand across North America with more flexibility while Ford secures a more stable supply of batteries. Ford recently announced plans to launch a mid-sized electric pickup truck priced in the $30,000 range with LFP batteries. By bringing the NCM (nickel, cobalt, manganese) battery JV online, Ford is diversifying its electrification strategy.
