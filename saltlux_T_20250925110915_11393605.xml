Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) participating in Samsung Electronics Co.’s smart factory support program are racking up awards, underscoring their innovation achievements.
At the 2025 Best of CHAMP+ Best Practices Contest hosted by the Human Resources Development Service of Korea, HyesungEIM won first place (Excellence Award) in the partnership category for applying Smart Factory Academy training content directly to its production sites.
HyesungEIM submitted a case study titled “Manufacturing Innovation for Small Enterprises through Workforce Development and Team-Based Activities.” From September 2024 to May 2025, nine employees ran a 14-week innovation task force at its manufacturing site, with three Samsung Electronics instructors serving as on-site mentors.
The results were clear: daily output increased by 25 percent, from 40 units to 50 units, and the company implemented 61 site improvement initiatives.
Since 2020, a cumulative 114 employees have completed Smart Factory Academy courses, building the company’s manufacturing innovation capabilities. The strong commitment of its CEO and active participation of employees in training have been credited for the achievements.
HyesungEIM is not alone in delivering results.
In September last year, three other SMEs in the Samsung smart factory program—Sancheongto Giwa, EVAR, and Hanseo Precision Industry—received the Minister of SMEs and Startups Award.
Sancheongto Giwa was recognized for introducing a manufacturing execution system (MES) and improving workflows to boost productivity and standardize the quality of traditional roof tiles. EVAR, a producer of EV chargers, enhanced its competitiveness to industry-leading levels through smart factory conversion, strengthening its position in the domestic market.
