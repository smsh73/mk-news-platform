Naver Cloud is positioning itself as Korea’s only company with full-stack AI capabilities that covers everything from infrastructure to user-facing services. The company says its expertise extends across the entire portfolio the government aims to promote in artificial intelligence.
“Naver is the only company with true full-stack AI capabilities spanning from infrastructure to services,” Naver Cloud head of hyperscale technology Nako Sung said during an interview at the company’s Green Factory headquarters in Seongnam last week. He emphasized that Naver possesses the full-stack expertise and global business execution needed to cover the government’s entire portfolio of AI initiatives.
In the AI field, full-stack capability means operating everything from AI cloud infrastructure to user-facing applications. Naver Cloud was recently selected alongside SK telecom, LG AI Research, NC AI, and Upstage as part of the government’s elite consortium to develop an independent AI foundation model, marking the start of a new phase of development competition.
Although competitors also claim to have full-stack strengths, Sung argued that Naver holds a decisive edge. The company was the first to build a large-scale language model, HyperCLOVA, operates high-performance computing (HPC) systems, and has hands-on experience designing multiple services. His vision extends beyond AI technology to building an entirely new ecosystem via platforms, enabling the easy creation of vertical AI agents in diverse fields and connecting them within a unified platform. In this ecosystem, AI agents would accumulate and manage personal data, providing customized AI services for all citizens.
At the core of the technology strategy is “omnimodal” learning. Unlike conventional multimodal approaches, which first train on text and then add other forms of data, omnimodal models train on text, images, and speech simultaneously from the outset. Sung said this focus is directly tied to creating AI services that can be widely experienced by the public.
The Naver Cloud consortium also includes TwelveLabs, Seoul National University, KAIST, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Korea University, and Hanyang University. Sung expressed confidence regarding the final selection stage of the government’s project, stating that “we must win, and we can win.”
