South Korea‘s Lotte GRS announced Wednesday that it has signed a partnership agreement with Serai Group, a Malaysian company operating in the food, beverage, and resort sectors, to open its first Lotteria outlet in Malaysia.
Executives from both companies, including Lotte GRS CEO Cha Woo-cheol and Serai Group Chairman Najib Hamid, attended the signing ceremony.
Also present was Shin Yoo-yeol, Executive Vice President and Head of Future Growth at Lotte Corporation—and the eldest son of Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin—who reaffirmed the group’s commitment to strengthening its global business capabilities through overseas expansion.
With this new partnership, Lotte GRS aims to open its first Lotteria store in Malaysia within the year and expand to 30 locations nationwide over the next five years.
In addition, the company plans to open its first Lotteria location in the United States this month, in California, and to enter the Singapore market shortly.
