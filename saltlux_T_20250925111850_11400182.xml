Samsung Electronics Co.’s Device Experience (DX) Division laid out its 2030 strategy centered on artificial intelligence, pledging a transformation in both business operations and workplace culture.
At the 2025 DX Connect town hall that took place on Thursday at the company’s Suwon campus, Mobile Experience (MX) chief and acting DX head Roh Tae-moon outlined the division’s roadmap. He said the rapid rise of AI is pushing the electronics industry to evolve at an unprecedented pace, requiring a redefinition of business strategies, work practices, and customer engagement.
Roh committed to positioning the DX Division as a leader in AI innovation at the forefront of transformation. He set three strategic directions for 2030: leading AI-based innovation, shifting to a sustainable business structure via new growth engines, and strengthening core capabilities in technology, manufacturing, and quality.
To achieve these goals, Roh identified six priorities across the division: embedding AI innovation in all products and services, improving productivity through AI, nurturing large-scale new businesses, expanding growth drivers in each business unit, securing next-generation technology leadership, and enhancing competitiveness in development, manufacturing, and quality through AI and data.
He also stressed the importance of workplace culture, vowing to create an environment where employees can take bold initiatives, share ideas freely, and work with passion across the organization.
The company’s employees approved a new division slogan, “Start Bold, Move Fast” during the event.
