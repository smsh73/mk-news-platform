South Korean animation producer Studio Mir saw its stock jump on Tuesday morning after “Golden,” the original soundtrack single from Netflix’s animated film, “KPop Demon Hunters,” topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.
Studio Mir shares rose 6.93 percent to 5,400 won ($3.88) as of 9:16 a.m.
Billboard said on Monday that Golden, the aspirational song from the soundtrack to the animated film KPop Demon Hunters, climbed one spot to number 1, overtaking Alex Warren’s “Ordinary.”
Studio Mir, which works with global streaming platforms including Netflix and Disney+, did not produce KPop Demon Hunters but is viewed as riding the wave of the recent hype.
Separately, NCSoft Corp.’s shares jumped 12.84 percent to 228,500 won as of 9:09 a.m. after the game maker estimated a second-quarter 2025 operating profit of 15.1 billion won, up 70.5 percent from a year earlier and well above the 5.5 billion won consensus compiled by Yonhap Infomax.
Sales rose 3.7 percent to 382.4 billion won. The company, however, swung to a net loss of 36 billion won mainly due to exchange rate effects.
For their parts, semiconductor heavyweights saw their shares rise after Micron Technology raised its quarterly earnings forecast on strong AI-related demand.
Samsung Electronics Co. stock was up 0.7 percent at 71,500 won, and SK hynix Inc. shares gained 1.5 percent to 271,000 won.
Micron Technology expected fiscal earnings for the fourth quarter of 2025 between $11.1 billion and $11.3 billion, up from its previous guidance of $10.4 billion to $11 billion, according to Reuters.
Studio Mir shares closed at 4,665 won and NCSoft shares closed at 223,000 won, while Samsung Electronics shares closed at 71,100 won and SK hynix shares closed at 269,000 won.
