Sono International Co., the holding company of Sono Hospitality Group, has decided to postpone its initial public offering (IPO) that was scheduled for this year.
The company said Monday it will strategically adjust the timing of its preliminary IPO review request after considering market conditions and its overall business environment.
The IPO had been planned for this year, but the company now plans to focus first on improving the financial health of T’way Air Co., which it acquired in June.
“Resolving T’way Air’s capital impairment will protect the interests of its minority shareholders and future investors in Sono International,” a company official said.
The company stressed that the listing plan remains in place, describing the adjustment as an active step to solidify long-term value rather than a simple delay.
Sono International operates a wide range of leisure assets, including 20 hotels and resorts in Korea and five overseas, as well as ski resorts, water parks, golf courses, and equestrian centers.
