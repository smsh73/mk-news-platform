Convenience store chain 7-Eleven is expanding its “beauty product tester zones” to all of its outlets after trial runs at about 50 locations showed significant sales growth. By addressing the long-standing limitation that customers cannot experience a product’s effects before purchasing it, the company aims to position itself as a daily lifestyle beauty platform.
According to industry sources on Sunday, 7-Eleven plans to roll out tester zones across all stores in the second half of 2025. The company had introduced testers at 50 stores since June 17th and conducted effectiveness analyses.
Sales manager Lee Si-woo of the Gangwon 2 team suggested the initiative at a town hall meeting in May 2025, noting that one of his stores in a new residential area with young couples and families often saw hesitant customers interested in beauty products. “After discussing with franchise owners, we placed tester products in stores and saw a sharp increase in sales. It would be beneficial to expand testers to all outlets,” he said.
The pilot proved successful. At the 50 stores where testers were installed, sales of the three trial products during the two-week period from June 17th to 30th increased about fourfold compared with the previous two weeks of June 3rd to 16th. Accompanying purchases of other beauty products also rose, lifting overall beauty category sales at those stores by around 20 percent.
“Unlike snacks or beverages, which customers can easily predict in terms of taste and features, shoppers are sensitive to fragrance, pigmentation, and absorption when purchasing beauty products, and are less willing to purchase the products without trying them,” 7-Eleven explained. “The tester initiative resolves this limitation.”
The company expects the initiative to help grow the “convenience store beauty” market. It plans to refine tester offerings based on customer and location data gathered during the pilot period, tailoring them to store demographics and neighborhood characteristics.
