South Korean banks are launching an all-out war against increasingly sophisticated voice phishing schemes.
With the government designating voice phishing as a representative crime that threatens people’s livelihoods, they are accelerating their response.
Shinhan Bank established a “Voice Phishing Protection Counter” at all of its 652 branches nationwide on Monday. The company will assign a manager-level employee to the locations during business hours to address voice phishing-related issues. The employees’ responsibilities include consulting with victims, freezing accounts, reporting incidents to the police, and coordinating with headquarters.
Shinhan Bank is the first in the financial sector to install dedicated anti-voice phishing counters at all branches.
For its part, state-run Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) is developing an artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice phishing detection service in collaboration with KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp., targeting a launch in October 2025.
Based on call patterns and banking transaction history, the system will either warn customers of high-risk transactions or block such transactions altogether.
