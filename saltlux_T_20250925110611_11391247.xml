Hanmi Semiconductor Co., South Korea‘s leading producer of thermal compression (TC) bonders, has unveiled an outdoor advertisement in Seoul featuring collaborative artwork with world-renowned pop artist Philip Colbert.
The move is part of an effort to establish a new brand image, the company said on Monday.
Colbert, a Scottish-born British artist, is acclaimed as the “next Andy Warhol” for his distinctive works characterized by bold, vibrant colors and cartoon-like elements.
He is also known as the “lobster artist,” presenting the lobster as both his artistic symbol and an extension of his own persona.
Colbert has collaborated on marketing campaigns with global brands such as Apple, Samsung, Nike, Bentley, Rolex, Montblanc, Christian Louboutin, and Comme des Garçons.
Since 2023, he has been partnering with the prestigious Italian Serie A football club AS Roma, breaking down boundaries between sports and art.
“I reinterpreted the Hanmi Semiconductor logo with a pop-art sensibility, and the logo colors blended naturally with the red lobster in my work,” Colbert said. “Through the free-flowing form of dripping paint, I captured the vitality and positive message of sunflowers.”
“This collaboration with world-class artist Colbert will serve as an opportunity to reinterpret Hanmi Semiconductor’s brand image in a sophisticated and artistic way,” a Hanmi Semiconductor official said. “We plan to continue building a unique brand value through fresh and creative marketing and innovative technology.”
