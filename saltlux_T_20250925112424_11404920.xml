<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/28/news-p.v1.20250828.c17074c6b77c477b9e7947c4d07a5736_P1.png' alt=' (Yonhap)'>
South Korean semiconductor stocks lost ground on Thursday morning, tracking a decline in Nvidia Corp.’s stock price during after-hours trading in the United States.
Shares of Samsung Electronics Co. were trading at 70,100 won ($50.43) as of 9:06 a.m. on Thursday, down 0.71 percent from the previous session.
SK hynix Inc. also fell 1.54 percent to 256,000 won.
The decline came after Nvidia’s shares dropped 3.1 percent in after-hours trading.
Nvidia’s shares slipped on weaker-than-expected performance in its data center business, despite its strong results in the second-quarter (May-July).
“Nvidia’s revenue exceeded market consensus, but the surprise factor was weaker than in the previous quarter,” said Ahn So-eun, an analyst at KB Securities Co. “In particular, data center sales came in slightly below expectations.”
“While some have raised doubts about the profitability of AI investments, given the upward trend in return on invested capital (ROIC) for most hyperscalers, or large-scale AI data center operators, it seems unlikely that the expansion of AI investment will suddenly lose momentum,” Ahn said. “Moreover, with expectations for Chinese demand already subdued, a resumption of exports to China following geopolitical improvements could serve as a future earnings surprise.”
Shares of Samsung Electronics closed at 69,600 won and SK hynix at 268,500 won.
