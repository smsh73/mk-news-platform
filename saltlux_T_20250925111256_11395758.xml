Labor unions are the biggest obstacle to the spread of artificial intelligence (AI) in South Korea, a survey showed on Sunday.
Maeil Business Newspaper and the Korean Academic Society of Business Administration (KASBA) released the results of a survey ahead of the 27th KASBA convergence conference that will take place in Ulsan for three days from Monday.
The survey was conducted among a total of 242 business administration researchers from July 22nd to 29th, 2025.,
According to the survey results, 31 percent of respondents, or 76 people, picked “labor unions” when asked,”Which group or institution do you think is the biggest obstacle to the spread of AI technology?”
This was followed by “the government” (21 percent, 51 people) and “corporate management” (21 percent, 51 people).
When asked to score the level of Korea’s AI adoption and spread on a scale of 100 points, 34 percent, or 83 respondents, gave a score of 71 to 80 points while 33 percent, or 81 respondents, gave a score of 61 to 70 points.
