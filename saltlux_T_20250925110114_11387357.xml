South Korean pharmaceutical company Huons reported its highest-ever quarterly revenue for the second quarter of this year, continuing its growth momentum with double-digit gains in profitability.
On Wednesday, the company announced preliminary consolidated results showing Q2 revenue of 156 billion won ($112 million), operating profit of 13.1 billion won, and net profit of 11.8 billion won. These figures represent year-on-year increases of 4.7 percent, 40.3 percent, and 46.5 percent, respectively.
Operating profit growth remained in double digits for the second consecutive quarter, signaling a steady recovery in profitability.
By segment, the prescription drug business led the charge with 69.1 billion won in revenue, driven by expanded exports of metabolic disorder treatments and injectable drugs. Notably, exports of injectables to North America surged 51 percent from a year earlier to 5.4 billion won.
The company’s contract manufacturing (CMO) division recorded revenue of 20.8 billion won, up 7.4 percent year-on-year, thanks to increased production of ophthalmic products.

The beauty and wellness segment saw revenue drop 13.3 percent to 42.2 billion won, largely due to the transfer of its health supplement business. However, excluding supplements, revenue rose 7.7 percent to 37 billion won, supported by strong sales of the continuous glucose monitor Dexcom G7.
Huons’ health supplement subsidiary Huonsen posted Q2 revenue of 18.7 billion won, up 76.7 percent from a year ago, and returned to profitability. Another subsidiary, Huons Life Sciences, also turned a profit in the same quarter. As of June, biopharmaceutical company PanGen has been consolidated as a subsidiary.
In May, Huons received abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its lidocaine injections (1 percent, 2 percent multi-dose vials). The company plans to use this approval to expand exports of dental anesthetics to the U.S.
Looking ahead, Huons aims to boost both revenue and profitability in the second half of this year with a new injectable production line at its second manufacturing plant, which is set to begin full-scale operations. The company sees the new line, scheduled for full operation later this year, as a key driver of both top-line growth and improved profitability.
