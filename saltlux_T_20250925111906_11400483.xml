<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/22/news-p.v1.20250822.a6263abef6434c3fb02e8ab675314386_P1.png' alt=' (Yonhap)'>
The Korea Communications Commission (KCC) ordered SK telecom to extend its penalty-free cancellation deadline until the end of 2025 and partially waive termination fees for bundled products. The decision, however, is a dispute mediation ruling, which means it takes effect only if SK telecom accepts it without objection. The company said it will carefully review the decision before responding.
The ruling was issued by the KCC’s Communications Dispute Mediation Committee on Thursday. The committee reviewed two cases filed by customers who were charged full termination penalties for canceling mobile service after the grace period had expired. It concluded that SK telecom must waive all termination fees if users apply to cancel mobile service before the end of the year. The committee said there is no legal basis for restricting or extinguishing a customer’s legitimate right to terminate a contract unless otherwise stipulated by law.
The committee also ruled that SK telecom must cover 50 percent of the termination fee burden borne by customers when they cancel bundled wired-wireless services. While these services are contracted separately, the committee noted they are effectively marketed as a single package.
Under dispute mediation procedures, the ruling becomes binding only if both parties accept it; if either side rejects it, the case ends without resolution. SK telecom stated it would “carefully examine the mediation decision before deciding on any further action.”
