<body><![CDATA[South Korean companies showcased their latest technologies that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) at the 27th Korean Academic Society of Business Administration (KASBA) Convergence Conference held in Ulsan on Tuesday.
The conference – held under the theme of “Value-up Management Innovation in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI)” was joined by companies seeking to unveil ways to utilize AI.
Data analytics company EWC hosted a demonstration of its AI-based personality test service, Mind Chaser, at the corporate exhibition booth set up in the Ulsan Exhibition & Convention Center (UECO).
Mind Chaser is a personality test in which respondents select one of five answers, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree,” for 245 questions.
Its printed analysis report includes not only the usual personality test results and response consistency scores but also a separately calculated AI personality test score.
As another example of AI being applied to human resources and organizational management, Simpatico Project showcased its AI-based mental care integrated platform Clify.
Built on employee support programs centered around organizational culture, Clify enables employers to monitor workers’ mental health in real time and actively assist with mental wellness management.
