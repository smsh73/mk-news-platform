OCI Holdings Co. said Tuesday it has sold the rights to a 100-megawatt solar power project in the United States to Turkey-based Sabanci Renewables Inc. The deal was finalized last week through OCI Energy, OCI’s U.S. solar subsidiary.
Financial terms were not disclosed.
The project, known as the Lucky 7 Project, involves building a 100MW utility-scale solar power plant on 745 acres (about 3 million square meters) in Hopkins County, northeast of Dallas, Texas.
OCI Energy completed early-stage development, including securing land, conducting site studies, obtaining permits, and arranging grid connections. Sabanci Renewables will take over construction and operations.
Once completed in 2027, the facility will generate enough electricity to power about 30,000 households for one day, based on a family of four. Demand in the area is expected to grow significantly, as a 3-gigawatt data center complex is scheduled to be built in Hopkins County by 2028.
“This year alone we have successfully developed and sold three projects — Sunlofer, Pepper, and Lucky 7 — totaling 480MW, putting our U.S. solar business on a stable growth trajectory,” an OCI Holdings official said. “We are accelerating efforts to develop and sell energy storage system (ESS)-linked projects to supplement solar power, as demand surges from the AI-driven data center boom in Texas.”
OCI Energy currently holds a pipeline of 5.9GW, with a 15 percent market share in the Texas solar development sector, ranking it first in the state.
