SK bioscience Co. and the Gates Foundation on Wednesday agreed to strengthen cooperation in global health ahead of founder Bill Gates’ visit to Korea.
SK bioscience said Thursday the two sides agreed to broaden collaboration beyond ongoing vaccine development and public health projects.
Discussions centered on next-generation preventive medicines, including vaccines for future pandemics.
Attendees included Trevor Mundel, president of global health at the Gates Foundation, SK discovery Co. Vice Chairman Chey Chang-won, and SK bioscience Chief Executive Officer Ahn Jae-yong.
SK bioscience and the Gates Foundation have collaborated since 2013 on projects such as typhoid and rotavirus vaccines and antiviral prevention solutions. The company cited the successful development and commercialization of Korea’s first Covid-19 vaccine in 2022 as a milestone outcome of the partnership.
Bill Gates and Mundel visited Korea that year to congratulate the achievement and met with SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won and Vice Chairman Chey.
Seven Korean pharmaceutical and biotech firms, including SK bioscience, LG Chem Ltd., Noul Co., Bioneer Corp., EuBiologics Co., SD Biosensor Inc., and Quadmedicine, in the meantime, attended the council meeting of the Research Investment for Global Health Technology Foundation (RIGHT Foundation) Thursday. Mundel also joined as a regular member.
At the meeting, Noul, an artificial intelligence-based diagnostics company, highlighted the role of AI in global health and presented its miLab platform, a portable on-device AI lab that automates processes from sample preparation to imaging and analysis.
CEO Lim Chan-yang said the platform enables cost-effective and accurate testing in low-resource settings, contributing to greater healthcare access.
The Gates Foundation considers adoption of AI technologies in low- and middle-income countries a priority to improve health equity. Noul said it plans to work with the foundation on innovative AI solutions to combat infectious diseases and expand access for vulnerable populations.
“Through this dialogue with the Gates Foundation, we will strengthen cooperation to tackle critical health challenges faced by children, women, and other vulnerable groups,” Lim said.
Citing the foundation’s support for AI initiatives in epidemic prediction, early disease detection, and chronic disease management, Mundel expressed hope that partnerships with Korean diagnostic companies could help advance health equity in low-income countries.
