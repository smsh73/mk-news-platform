<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/11/news-p.v1.20250811.c77e0cc4a4ca483a9174b14073185aed_P1.jpg' alt=' (MK DB)'>
Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered phone agents, capable of making calls and completing tasks on behalf of users, are beginning to move beyond enterprise applications and into everyday consumer use.
The technology enables users to delegate tasks such as booking restaurant reservations, confirming menu options, or canceling service subscriptions without speaking directly to a human representative.
By processing natural voice conversations in real time, the AI can navigate automated menus, wait on hold, and respond to inquiries in a natural tone.
In June, U.S.-based AI search startup Genspark launched its call assistant service known as AI Call For M in Korea.
Users link their phone number, including those beginning with the country code +82, to the Genspark platform and enter the name, number, and purpose of the call. The AI then places the call and completes the request.
The service also supports overseas calls, enabling, for example, a user in Seoul to reserve a table at a restaurant in Tokyo without speaking Japanese.
In the United States, startup Fine AI has developed a similar service focused on customer service functions, including canceling telecom plans or cable TV subscriptions and requesting airline compensation. The tasks remain phone-based in many cases, prompting demand for automation.
Deedy Das, partner at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, described Fine AI as “the first AI agent product that saves so much time” by handling calls users often postpone due to their length.
One key to the technology’s viability is reducing latency in conversations.
Traditional systems relied on speech-to-text (STT) conversion, text-based processing, and text-to-speech (TTS) output, which could slow interactions. New multimodal AI models can now process and generate speech directly, enabling near real-time responses.
No consumer-facing AI call agent services are so far available in Korea outside Genspark’s offering.
LG Uplus Corp. is reviewing the addition of outbound call functions to its AI call application ixi-O, which already answers calls on behalf of users and records the conversation when they are unavailable.
