South Korea’s leading petrochemical companies are under growing pressure to refinance debt of more than 2.5 trillion won ($1.87 billion) maturing by the end of 2025, amid government demands for sweeping industry restructuring.
According to the investment banking industry on Tuesday, 10 major naphtha cracking center (NCC) operators - LG Chem, GS Caltex, HD Hyundai Chemical, SK geocentric, Lotte Chemical, Hanwha Solutions, Hanwha TotalEnergies Petrochemical, S-Oil, Yeochun NCC, and Korea Petrochemical Ind. - must repay or roll over a combined 2.55 trillion won in corporate bonds and short-term borrowings such as commercial paper and short-term notes in 2025. Of the total, 1.66 trillion won, or more than 65 percent, are short-term debts with maturities averaging less than three months, forcing companies into repeated refinancing. A minor disruption in market conditions could quickly trigger liquidity stress. Hanwha Solutions, Hanwha TotalEnergies Petrochemical, and HD Hyundai Chemical were among those most reliant on short-term funding.
Profitability remains too weak to cover their financing costs. The average interest coverage ratio for these firms was about 2 times, below the credit industry’s safe threshold of 3 times as of the first quarter of 2025, signaling fragile debt-servicing capacity. Credit rating agencies have already issued negative outlooks on companies including Hanwha Solutions, HD Hyundai Chemical, and SK geocentric, adding further refinancing hurdles.
“The risk of defaults among petrochemical corporate bonds is rising,” Shinhan Investment & Securities analyst Kim Sang-in. “Companies will face greater challenges managing liquidity while relying more heavily on bank loans.”
Industry fundamentals also show no clear recovery signs. Accumulated oversupply, tariff concerns, and broader macroeconomic uncertainties - coupled with the global economic slowdown - are likely to constrain any industry rebound in the second half of 2025.
In response, several companies have turned to asset sales. LG Chem sold its water treatment filter unit for 1.4 trillion won in June and its aesthetics business for 200 billion won in July 2025. Lotte Chemical has also offloaded overseas subsidiaries, including a 40 percent stake in its Louisiana unit through a 662.6 billion won price return swap in late 2024, followed by a 25 percent stake in its Indonesian unit (650 billion won) and a 75 percent stake in its Pakistan unit (97.9 billion won) this year.
The government has ordered companies to submit concrete restructuring plans by the end of the year, aiming to cut up to 3.7 million tons of NCC capacity. Financial regulators are weighing support measures, but only in return for self-help efforts and active restructuring. The banking sector’s exposure to petrochemical firms currently stands at around 16 trillion won.
