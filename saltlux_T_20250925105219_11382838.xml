As the global shift toward green vehicles accelerates, South Korean auto parts maker Hallacast Co. is betting on lightweight metal components to drive its next phase of growth — and propel it toward unicorn status.
“We aim to become a unicorn company in the future vehicle materials sector,” Hallacast Chief Executive Officer Oh Jong-doo told Maeil Business Newspaper in a recent interview, ahead of the company’s Kosdaq listing.
Founded in 1996, Hallacast designs and manufactures heat-dissipating aluminum and magnesium-based materials tailored to the evolving demands of global automakers.
Positioned as a greener alternative to steel, its lightweight components are increasingly in demand as EV makers grapple with the need to offset the weight of larger batteries and semiconductors.
Hallacast holds the largest market share among firms capable of producing large-scale magnesium parts and supplies products to major global automakers through its primary clients. It has also been tapped as a direct supplier to a global autonomous driving company and is expanding into parts for electric conversion systems, humanoid robots, and robotaxis.
Even amid a slowdown in EV demand, Hallacast has managed to post an annual sales growth of 20.1 percent on average over the past five years. Proceeds from its initial public offering will go toward boosting production capacity and trimming interest expenses, the company said.
Hallacast will offer 7.5 million new shares, with a price range set between 5,100 and 5,800 won ($4.15) per share. Bookbuilding is being held until August 5, followed by retail subscriptions on August 11 and 12. Daishin Securities Co. is acting as lead underwriter.
