LG has established South Korea’s first in-house graduate school to be approved by the Ministry of Education, the LG AI Graduate School. This marks the first time a corporate-run graduate program has been officially recognized as a lifelong education institution authorized to confer degrees.
The ministry said Sunday it had approved the establishment of the LG AI Graduate School (master’s program), applied for by LG Academy of Management and AI Research Institute.
Graduates will be granted degrees equivalent to those of conventional graduate schools. This was made possible after the Ministry of Education granted official approval under Article 4 of the Special Act on Innovation of Human Resources in Advanced Industries, which took effect in January. Until now, corporate in-house schools could only confer qualifications up to the associate and bachelor’s level, while graduate-level degree-granting programs have been rare both in Korea and worldwide.
LG AI Graduate School is also seeking approval for its doctoral program by the end of the year. The school is scheduled to open on Sept. 30, with Honglak Lee, co-director of the LG AI Research, serving as its inaugural dean. LG will begin recruiting students in September and plans to hold its first matriculation ceremony in March 2026.
The graduate school aims to nurture practice-oriented talent to drive the world’s three leading AI powers. Twenty-five professors with experience in both academia and industry will offer field-tailored education combining cutting-edge theory with industrial data-driven problem solving. Students will also gain hands-on experience by addressing internal LG challenges and participating in national AI projects.
LG has included “Responsible AI” and “Inclusive AI” ethics courses in the official curriculum, underscoring its commitment to advancing human-centered AI philosophy beyond technical training.
“In connecting industry, research, and education, the LG AI Graduate School will serve as a convergence platform,” said Lee. “Through this, LG will complete its full-cycle AI education ecosystem, continue to enhance it, and ultimately contribute to strengthening the nation’s AI competitiveness over the long term.”
