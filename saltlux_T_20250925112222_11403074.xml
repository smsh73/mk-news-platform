<body><![CDATA[The total number of companies affiliated with South Koreaâ€™s large business groups with assets of 5 trillion won ($3.6 billion) or more has declined in 2025 as large corporations have split and merged their affiliates in the past three months, a report showed on Monday.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) on Monday released its latest report on changes in the number of conglomerate affiliates between May and July 2025. The number of companies under 92 conglomerates decreased by 12 from 3,301 on May 1st to 3,289 as of August 1st, according to the report.
A total of 61 new affiliates were added to 34 business groups via company establishment (25 new firms and 4 spin-offs) and equity acquisitions (14 companies). On the other hand, 73 companies were excluded from 36 groups due to mergers (31 companies), equity sales (11 companies), and liquidations (19 companies).
The KFTC noted that many groups were actively incorporating affiliates that could create synergies with their existing core operations, instead of diversifying into entirely new businesses. LG brought Bear Robotics Korea under its wing, for example, to strengthen its existing robotics business.
