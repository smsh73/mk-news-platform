Baemin expands 1-hour delivery service with Homeplus
By Lee Sun-hui and Minu Kim
Baemin and Homeplus are scaling up their partnership to deliver groceries and household items within an hour, expanding their quick commerce footprint.
Baemin operator Woowa Brothers announced on Tuesday that it will expand its fast delivery service, launched in April 2025, from 6 Homeplus hypermarkets to 41 locations nationwide. The service allows customers to order from the Baemin Shopping tab and receive items within an hour.
More than 10,000 customers have used the service since its launch, with monthly user numbers steadily increasing.
To celebrate the expansion, Baemin is offering promotional discounts for customers using Homeplus delivery between August 6th and 14th. Shoppers who spend over 30,000 won, or nearly $22, will receive a 3,000 won delivery coupon, while those spending over 40,000 won will receive an additional 2,000 won discount. First-time users spending more than 25,000 won can get 10 percent off (up to 10,000 won), with a maximum total discount of 15,000 won.
