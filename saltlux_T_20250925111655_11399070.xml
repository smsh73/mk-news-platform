Major business lobby groups in South Korea are launching a Corporate Growth Forum to propose regulatory reforms and policy alternatives aimed at restoring the dynamism of the nation’s economy.
The Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI), and the the Federation of Middle Market Enterprises of Korea (FDMEK) held a kickoff meeting at the KCCI headquarters in Seoul on Wednesday.
The groups discussed the causes of Korea’s economic stagnation and possible solutions, citing size-based differential regulations embedded throughout the legal system as a key reason for the weakened incentives for corporate growth.
In contrast to the United States, where only Microsoft among the top 10 companies by market capitalization two decades ago still remains in the top tier, Korea’s lineup of leading corporations has barely changed.
Samsung, SK, Hyundai Motor, LG, and Posco continue to dominate, with only HD Hyundai and NongHyup joining the list. Likewise, Korea’s top 10 export items—semiconductors, automobiles, ships, wireless communication devices, and petroleum products—have remained virtually the same for 20 years.
Industry leaders argue that regulations are the core factor behind this lack of dynamism.
Size-based restrictions, they say, not only erode incentives for growth but also hinder industrial restructuring.
During the meeting, KCCI Executive Vice Chairman Park Il-jun, FKI Executive Vice Chairman Kim Chang-beom, and FDMEK Executive Vice Chairman Lee Ho-jun agreed that regulations should shift from a protection-focused framework to one promoting growth, and that support should be provided on a project basis rather than distributed broadly.
Kim called for a redesign of incentive structures so that companies “want to grow on their own.”
He suggested easing the external investment cap on corporate venture capital firms (currently set at 40 percent), eliminating discriminatory regulations based on company size, and reducing financial and tax-related disparities.
Park stressed that regulations should be tailored to industry-specific characteristics rather than company scale, and ultimately transitioned into a system of self-regulation with only basic principles set by law.
Kwak Kwan-hoon, head of the Korean Academy of High Potential Enterprises, added that “mid-sized companies need institutional support such as deregulation more urgently than financial aid.” He proposed that if strong mid-sized firms pursue business diversification, easing holding company regulations should be considered.
