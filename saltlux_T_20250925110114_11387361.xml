South Korea’s Minister of Science and ICT Baek Kyung-hoon is set to hold his first meeting with the CEOs of the country’s major telecom companies since taking office, with artificial intelligence and cybersecurity expected to top the agenda.
According to telecom industry sources on Wednesday, Minister Baek is arranging a meeting with Ryu Young-sang of SK telecom, Kim Young-Shub of KT, and Hong Beom-sik of LG Uplus. While the date is still being finalized, the meeting is likely to take place on September 11.
The planned gathering comes amid a flurry of telecom-related issues, including the proposed repeal of the Mobile Device Distribution Improvement Act, recent hacking incidents targeting telecom servers, rising household telecom costs, and the need for expanded investment in AI infrastructure.
Particular attention is expected to be paid to sovereign AI initiatives, especially as SK telecom and LG Uplus are participating—either as lead developers or partners—in a new national AI foundation model development project. The upcoming South Korea-U.S. summit may also bring the issue of mandatory network usage fees into the conversation.
