SK telecom Co. saw its second-quarter operating profit plunge by more than 37 percent due to the aftermath of a major hacking incident in April that triggered subscriber losses and one-off costs.
The mobile carrier announced on Wednesday that its operating profit stood at 338.3 billion won ($243.4 million) in the April-June period, down 37.1 percent from the same period a year ago. Sales reached 4.3 trillion won, down 1.9 percent, and net profit was 83.2 billion won, down 76.2 percent during the same period.
SK telecom’s operating profit fell 40.4 percent, and net profit declined 77 percent compared to the previous quarter.
The company blamed the earnings slump on one-time expenses, including customer SIM card replacements and compensation for agency losses following the breach, which disrupted service and eroded customer trust.
Despite the decline, the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) business continued to grow.
Sales from AI-related businesses rose 13.9 percent in the second quarter from a year ago.
The AI data center division posted 108.7 billion won in revenue, up 13.3 percent, fueled by higher utilization.
In June, the company unveiled a plan to build Korea’s largest hyperscale AI data center in Ulsan, in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SK Group affiliates. The facility is expected to be operational by 2027.
