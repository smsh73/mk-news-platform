Hanwha Corp., the holding company of South Korea’s Hanwha Group, has revised its corporate governance charter for the first time in more than three years to introduce measures that aim to strengthen shareholder rights.
The updated charter, which was announced on Wednesday, includes provisions requiring shareholder resolutions to be conducted transparently and fairly, and obliges the board to respond to shareholder questions at annual meetings. It also commits the company to making it easier for shareholders to exercise voting rights and propose agenda items.
The new rules specify that individuals who damage corporate value or infringe shareholder rights will not be eligible for board appointments. The revisions also call for greater board diversity and permit separate meetings for external directors to enhance oversight.
The move comes as the South Korean government pushes amendments to the Commercial Act to expand directors’ fiduciary duties to shareholders.
However, Hanwha said the revisions were not tied to the proposed legal changes but were a part of its effort to codify its ESG practices.
