Major South Korean conglomerates that raised funds for their subsidiaries from private equity funds (PEFs) on the premise of a stock market listing are now facing a capital management emergency.
This is because amendments to the country’s Commercial Act have disrupted the long-standing practice of listing subsidiaries to return funds to investors.
According to sources from the capital market on Monday, it is estimated that unlisted affiliates of major Korean business groups have raised more than 12 trillion won ($8.64 billion) from PEF managers.
The largest amount was raised by SK Group, with SK Innovation E&S securing a total of 3.14 trillion won from global PEF manager KKR between 2021 and 2022 through redeemable convertible preferred shares (RCPS) issued by its city gas subsidiary.
These RCPS were designed to give SK Innovation E&S the option to decide on redemption five years after issuance.
SK ecoplant Co. also raised 1 trillion won in 2022 in the form of a pre-IPO (pre-listing investment) from a PEF manager, while SK pharmteco Inc. secured an investment worth around 600 billion won during the pre-IPO stage in 2023.
Other affiliates, including SK Plasma Co. (165 billion won in 2024), SK Square Co.’s subsidiary 11Street Co. (500 billion won in 2018), and Tmap Mobility Co. (400 billion won in 2021), also attracted hundreds of billions of won in PEF funds.
Kakao Group also raised more than 3 trillion won from PEF managers.
Kakao Entertainment Corp. received about 1.2 trillion won and 335 billion won from Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), Singapore’s Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), and Anchor Equity Partners between 2020 and 2023.
Kakao Mobility Corp. (920 billion won), Kakao Japan Corp. (600 billion won), and Kakao VX Corp. (144 billion won) also attracted large-scale PEF funding around 2021.
However, duplicate listings of subsidiaries have been regarded as taboo in recent years as they transfer the value of core businesses externally and negatively affect parent company valuations due to the issuance of new shares by subsidiaries.
The revised Commercial Act also strengthened directors’ fiduciary duty to shareholders, creating conditions for parent company boards to oppose duplicate subsidiary listings even without explicit legal consent requirements.
“In a situation where subsidiary listings have become difficult, if major shareholders or groups lack liquidity, it is inevitable to bring in new financial investors (FIs) or resort to high-cost structures such as total return swaps (TRS),” Kim Seo-ha, a partner at Boston Consulting Group, said. “Companies may lose out on the fundraising opportunities they expected via these subsidiary listings.”
