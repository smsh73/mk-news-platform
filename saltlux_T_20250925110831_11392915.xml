COSMAX Inc. is making a decisive push into the hospital and clinic market, leveraging its expertise in skin microbiome technology.
The company announced on Wednesday that it received Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety for its MD Cream - an adhesive wound dressing infused with ‘Untopinol,’ a microbiome-derived active ingredient. The certification paves the way for COSMAX to expand the development of medical-grade skincare products for healthcare institutions.
According to the company, the MD Cream stands out for its ability to improve skin conditions without the side effects often associated with steroid-based treatments. This aligns with COSMAX’s previously stated goal of introducing steroid-free solutions for sensitive skin using microbiome technology.
The formulation is the result of joint research with Harvard Medical School, which identified the skin-soothing benefits and biological mechanisms of microbiome-derived ingredients. Untopinol, the cream’s key component, is extracted from ‘Fillerstin,’ an anti-aging microbiome strain optimized and cultured to address inflammatory skin concerns.
In clinical trials involving 100 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, 46.2 percent saw a reduction in severity. The cream also showed measurable improvements in skin barrier function, hydration, and inflammation markers.
COSMAX aims to launch the Untopinol MD Cream via its client network by the first half of 2026. Beyond hospital-exclusive lines, the company plans to expand into functional cosmetics, working closely with dermatologists and allergists to build a prescription-grade skincare portfolio. It is also ramping up efforts to commercialize new biomaterials via advanced microbiome research.
