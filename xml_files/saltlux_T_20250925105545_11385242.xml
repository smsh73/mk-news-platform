South Korean beauty tech company APR Corp. said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it will cancel all 613,400 shares of its treasury stock.
The shares were acquired under a trust agreement announced in February. NH Investment & Securities Co. was designated as the trustee.
The amount of treasury stock to be canceled represents 1.61 percent of APR’s entire issued shares, with the value amounting to approximately 30 billion won ($22 million) based on the average acquisition price of 48,911 won per share for common treasury shares.
As a result of the cancellation, the total number of issued shares is expected to decrease from 38,044,055 to 37,430,655.
The cancellation date is set for Thursday.
According to APR, this decision is part of its strategy to maximize shareholder value, which was outlined in its 2024 to 2026 Shareholder Return Policy announced in 2024. In that disclosure, APR pledged to conduct annual cash dividends, treasury stock repurchases, and cancellations over those three years.
It also stated at the time that the scale of the returns would exceed 25 percent of its consolidated adjusted net income each year.
APR‘s shareholder return rate for 2024 reached 55.7 percent.
APR’s management expressed its commitment to responsible management and executed a treasury stock buyback in May 2024.
This was followed by a 60 billion won buyback decision in June and a 30 billion won buyback in February 2025.
In particular, the company canceled all its treasury shares acquired in June 2024 in January 2025.
Canceling treasury shares is a key method of enhancing shareholder value, as it reduces the total number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BPS) and ultimately raising the value of each shareholder’s stake.
APR also plans to enhance its shareholder communication through various channels to provide accurate information.
The company currently publishes investment information in both Korean and English on its website to improve investor accessibility and hosts earnings conferences with live audio streaming.
“The latest decision is the second active shareholder return initiative this year,” a company official said. “We will continue to prove the value of our company through steady growth and efforts to maximize shareholder value.”
