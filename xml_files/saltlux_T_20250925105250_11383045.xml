<body><![CDATA[As Korean cosmetics continue to gain popularity overseas, leading Korean hair salon brands are stepping up their international expansion efforts.
According to Juno Beauty, which operates Juno Hair, the company recently opened one salon each in Manila and Bangkok, with plans to launch a second and third location in Bangkok as early as 2025. Juno Hair opened its first overseas branch in the Philippines in 2024 and gained strong traction among the local upper class, boosting the companyâ€™s confidence in its global ambitions. The company also held a recent seminar in Japan as part of its preparations to enter the Japanese market.
A Juno Beauty official said the company plans to gradually expand to major cities around the world, including Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, Los Angeles, and Paris.
Meanwhile, Park Seung-chol Hair Studio is also making a foray into the international market. PSC Networks, which operates the brand, signed an agreement on July 23rd, 2025, with Grand View Property- a subsidiary of Kolao Group - to bring the Korean hair salon service brand to Laos.
Kolao Group was founded in Laos in 1997 by Korean entrepreneur Oh Se-young.
