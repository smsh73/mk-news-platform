Naver announced on Wednesday that it signed a comprehensive partnership agreement with JNPMEDI, a South Korean digital healthcare company specializing in clinical trial data platforms and contract research organization (CRO) services.
Under the agreement, Naver will invest in JNPMEDI and collaborate to enhance both companies’ artificial intelligence (AI) and clinical trial platforms. The partnership aims to build digital capabilities necessary for global expansion by combining Naver’s software and AI expertise with JNPMEDI’s domain knowledge.
The collaboration is also designed to support the secure management and technological independence of clinical trial data, which is considered a national strategic asset. Naver emphasized that it seeks to develop advanced digital clinical trial capabilities to facilitate overseas market entry.
“This partnership will allow us to discover and invest in promising digital healthcare companies at home and abroad,” Choi In-hyuk, head of Naver’s Tech Business division, said. “We plan to support their global expansion and mutual growth.”
Choi also noted that integrating Naver’s AI technology with JNPMEDI’s clinical trial platform expertise will accelerate product development.
Naver has been steadily expanding its footprint in healthcare technology. Its innovations include Smart Survey, which converts patient interview responses into standardized medical terms for electronic medical records (EMRs), and Patient Summary, which uses AI to summarize and analyze patients’ past medical examinations.
Naver’s D2SF has been investing in healthcare startups since 2017, with healthcare companies accounting for 18 percent of D2SF’s total investment portfolio as of August 2025.
