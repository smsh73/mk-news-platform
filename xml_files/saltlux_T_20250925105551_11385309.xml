“Baby Shark,” the viral global hit from South Korean children’s entertainment brand Pinkfong, has achieved a new milestone in the global music market. The Pinkfong Company announced on Monday that the song has been certified 5X Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), marking the first time a Korean entertainment property—including any K-pop artist—and a children’s song worldwide has earned the recognition.
The 5X Platinum certification is awarded to singles that exceed 3 million units sold in the United Kingdom, including downloads and streaming equivalents.
Baby Shark is now the highest-certified song ever by a Korean artist in the UK, and the only kids’ song globally to reach this level.
Since its release, Baby Shark has expanded into genres including classical, acoustic, hip-hop, and EDM, continuing to attract global listeners and maintain popularity in the competitive music market.
The song made its debut on the Billboard Hot 100 in January 2019, reaching No. 32 and remaining on the chart for 20 consecutive weeks, signaling the beginning of its worldwide phenomenon.
Its record-breaking streak has continued.
In 2020, it received Double Platinum certification from BPI (for over 1.2 million units sold) and was also the first Korean and first kids’ song to earn a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), along with 11 multi-Platinum digital single certifications.
In 2022, the song surpassed 200 million streams in the UK according to the Official Charts, and by 2023, it had accumulated 1 billion streams on Spotify with 4.3 million monthly listeners, demonstrating its dominance across digital platforms.
Last year, it also earned Gold certification from France’s SNEP and became the most-streamed music video in the UK, further solidifying its status as a powerful music IP.
These achievements highlight how Baby Shark has evolved from a viral hit into a long-lasting global music property enjoyed across generations, experts noted.
The Pinkfong Company plans to continue expanding the global footprint of Korean content through genre-crossing musical experiments and cultural innovation.
To mark the 10th anniversary of the song, the company will release a limited-edition liquid vinyl album and unveil a new music video in collaboration with the London Symphony Orchestra in the third quarter, further expanding the IP’s musical and cultural reach.
“This 5X Platinum certification is a testament to Baby Shark’s impact as a global content brand beyond a one-hit wonder,” a company spokesperson said. “As an IP that has resonated with audiences worldwide across cultures and generations, we aim to continue delivering meaningful experiences through diverse content.”
