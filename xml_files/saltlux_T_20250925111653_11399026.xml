Samsung Electronics Co. faces new conditions that could affect its U.S. investment strategy as Washington moves to link semiconductor subsidies with equity stakes.
Reuters reported on Tuesday (local time) that U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is in talks with Intel Corp. for the government to receive an equity stake in exchange for subsidies under the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act (CHIPS Act). The U.S. government is also considering applying this approach to other chipmakers.
Analysts say the U.S. plan effectively turns CHIPS Act subsidies into equity stakes, strengthening Washington’s hold on key semiconductor companies. Companies likely to be affected include companies such as Samsung Electronics. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), and Micron Technology Inc. U.S. media previously reported that the White House had discussed acquiring a ten percent stake in Intel by converting part or all of its subsidies into equity.
In an interview with CNBC the same day, Lutnick said the funding committed under the Biden administration will be delivered but emphasized that the government aims to secure equity “in return for it.”
Before the end of Biden’s term, the Commerce Department finalized subsidy amounts of approximately $6.6 billion for TSMC and $4.75 billion for Samsung Electronics. If Samsung declines the subsidies to avoid government ownership, it will face an unexpected loss of about $4.75 billion. However, if it accepts the equity requirement, the U.S. government would obtain roughly 1.5 percent of Samsung’s market capitalization as of August 19th, 2025.
“Samsung’s chip division is probably under pressure right now. With a bilateral summit already on the schedule, the company will find it hard to voice objections to Washington’s equity demand,” an industry official said.
