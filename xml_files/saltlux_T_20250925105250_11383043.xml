Shillakwon, a funeral hall operated by Woongjin Preed Life in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, is redefining traditional perceptions of death and mourning. Opened in 2020, the facility spans from one basement level to three above ground and resembles a clean, modern hotel more than a typical funeral hall.
Of particular note is the funeral culture museum located on the second floor. It exhibits about 90 items, including traditional funeral garments from the Joseon Dynasty, a memorial tablet of King Jeongjo, a procession painting of King Jeongjo’s royal funeral, funeral bier decorations, and wooden dolls called kokdu.
Panels on display also explore the evolution of Korean burial customs from prehistoric times to the Joseon era. The museum’s credibility is reinforced by the involvement of experts, including former National Palace Museum director Jeong Jong-soo, in artifact selection and curation.
The Shillakwon branch in Incheon goes further by housing an art gallery. During a recent visit by Maeil Business Newspaper, several local residents—not mourners—were viewing works by emerging artists. The venue exhibits around 20 pieces, including Kang Doo-hyeong’s “Dream of a Fish” and “Village Where Pinecone Birds Live,” in support of young creators.
Shillakwon has also become a popular filming location for Korean dramas, with over 60 shows including “Taxi Driver“ featuring scenes shot at its facilities.
