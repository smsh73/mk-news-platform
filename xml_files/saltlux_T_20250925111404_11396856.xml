More than half of South Korean workers are using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in their work, a survey showed on Monday.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) released the results of a survey on AI’s rapid spread and its effects on productivity, which was conducted in May and June 2025 among 5,512 employed individuals aged 15 to 64 nationwide.
According to the survey results, 63.5 percent of Korean workers used generative AI at least once during the cited period, with 51.8 percent using it specifically for work purposes. This is significantly higher than the adoption rate in the United States (26.5 percent) or the usage rate three years after the Internet’s commercialization (7.8 percent).
When broken down by demographic, usage rates were higher among men (55.1 percent), younger workers aged 18 to 29 (67.5 percent), and those with a graduate-level education (72.9 percent), compared with women (47.7 percent), older workers aged 50 to 64 (35.6 percent), and those with a college degree or lower (38.4 percent).
By occupation, professionals (69.2 percent), managers (65.4 percent), and office workers (63.1 percent) were the most active users of generative AI.
AI usage was found to reduce working hours by 1.5 hours per week on the basis of a 40-hour workweek, a 3.8 percent reduction overall, with the potential productivity improvement rate at 1 percent.
When applied to Korea’s GDP, this suggests that around 1 percentage point of the 3.9 percent growth recorded between the fourth quarter of 2022 - when ChatGPT was released - and the second quarter of 2025 can be attributed to the potential contribution of AI adoption.
The BOK made it clear, however, that this estimate assumes that workers used the reduced working hours for additional productive activities.
Workers using generative AI in their work spent 5 to 7 hours per week on AI tools, equivalent to 12.1 to 16.6 percent of their total working hours based on a 40-hour workweek, according to the survey.
