The number of economically active people aged 55 and older in South Korea has surpassed 10 million for the first time, data showed on Wednesday.
According to a survey released by Statistics Korea, the economically active population aged 55 to 79 reached 10.01 million, up 328,000 compared to the same period last year.
Among them 9.78 million were employed, up by 344,000.
This trend is largely attributed to the fact that more than half of the elderly population cannot sustain their livelihoods on pension income alone, forcing them to remain in the labor market by taking on unstable jobs into old age.
Only 51.7 percent of seniors received a pension, and the average monthly amount was just 860,000 won ($620), well below the minimum monthly living cost for a single elderly person at 1.36 million won.
In addition, 69 percent of elderly respondents – about 11.42 million people – expressed a desire to work in the future. Their average desired retirement age rose slightly from the previous year to 73.4 years.
Experts noted that the prolonged participation of seniors in the labor market is closely tied to both insufficient retirement preparation and increasing life expectancy.
