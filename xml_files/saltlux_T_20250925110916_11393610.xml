Korean big-box retailer Homeplus Co., which has been seeking a buyer as it remains in court receivership, will sequentially close 15 stores as part of efforts to address financial strain.
The company announced the closures on Wednesday as part of a companywide emergency survival drive aimed at easing cash pressure and preparing for restructuring until a pre-receivership-approval merger and acquisition (M&A) deal is completed.
The 15 stores targeted are among 68 leased outlets where rent renegotiations have stalled. Homeplus operates 125 stores and with eight closures decided before receivership alongside the latest move, a total of 23 stores will be shuttered to reduce the total to 102.
The company will also offer an unpaid leave program for all headquarters employees on a voluntary basis from September 1st, 2025, onwards. An executive pay cut program introduced in March will remain in place until restructuring is complete.
In a message to employees, Co-Chief Executive Officer Cho Ju-yeon described the measure as a last resort to avoid jeopardizing a pre-approval M&A-led recovery. Homeplus said it had no alternative, noting that it has kept all stores open, maintained staffing levels, and paid suppliers on time since entering receivership in early March, but has seen no clear improvement in its finances.
However, the Homeplus labor union criticized the decision, accusing majority shareholder MBK Partners of failing to make any self-help efforts.
