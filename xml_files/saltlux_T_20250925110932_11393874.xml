As South Korea marks the 60th anniversary of normalized diplomatic ties with Japan, calls are emerging for a Korea-Japan free trade agreement (FTA).
A state-run research institute, however, has warned that such an agreement could widen Korea’s trade deficit with Japan. While Korea is expected to see export gains in certain sectors – such as petrochemicals, plastics, and metals – imports from Japan in automobiles, electronics, and petrochemicals are projected to rise by an even greater margin.
The Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET) released a report on Wednesday, which showed that 24 of Korea’s top 10 export items to Japan would benefit from tariff reductions under an FTA, particularly in petroleum projects, certain plastics, chemicals, and metal goods, where immediate tariff cuts could be expected.
However, since petroleum products – Korea’s single most important export category to Japan, accounting for more than 17.8 percent of total exports – already face tariffs of below 1 percent, the report concluded that any additional export boost from tariff cuts in this sector would be limited.
On the import side, 54 of the top 100 items Korea buys from Japan would see tariffs lowered or eliminated.
Automobiles, subject to an 8 percent tariff and excluded from concessions under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) between Seoul and Tokyo, could be imported tariff-free, likely boosting Japanese car sales in Korea.
KIET emphasized that the economic benefits of a Korea-Japan FTA should be assessed more broadly than through the lens of the trade balance alone.
Easier access to Japanese intermediate goods and equipment could improve productivity for domestic manufacturers.
From a consumer perspective, increased imports from Japan could lead to lower prices and more product choices.
In particular, the report suggested that a Korea-Japan FTA should be viewed as an institutional mechanism for fostering stable economic cooperation between the two countries.
