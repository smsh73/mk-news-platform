Naver Labs, the R&D arm of Naver Corp. focused on future technologies, has surpassed 950 cumulative patent filings and is on track to exceed 1,000 by the end of the year, according to industry sources on Sunday.
Naver Labs had filed more than 950 patents as of July, with 460 already registered. Its European research subsidiary, Naver Labs Europe (NLE)—the largest AI research institute in Europe—has also filed over 250 patents.
Combined, Naver Labs and NLE now hold more than 1,200 patent filings, the largest total among South Korean internet companies. These patents represent an estimated 35 to 50 percent of Naver‘s overall patent activity.
Established in 2017, Naver Labs has filed more than 100 patents annually since 2020. The company has concentrated its research on spatial intelligence technologies such as digital twins and autonomous driving, aimed at extending Naver’s platforms into the offline world. More than 60 percent of its filings are related to spatial intelligence.
