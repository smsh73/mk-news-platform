France’s Air Liquide has emerged as the leading contender to acquire DIG Airgas Co., one of South Korea’s top industrial gas firms, after submitting the highest bid in the final round, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The bidding process, managed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs, has narrowed to three finalists – Air Liquide, Canadian investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, and U.S.-based Stonepeak.
All three submitted final bids on Wednesday for a full stake in DIG Airgas owned by Macquarie Group Limited.
Air Liquide has reportedly submitted a bid as high as 4 trillion won ($2.88 billion), placing it ahead of other contenders and making it the likely front-runner, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Macquarie acquired DIG Airgas from MBK Partners in 2019 for 2.5 trillion won. The asset has been on the market since early this year.
Sellers are said to be targeting a valuation exceeding 20 times EBITDA, with DIG Airgas reporting 208.7 billion won in EBITDA last year.
Founded in 1979 through a joint venture with Daesung Industrial Co., DIG Airgas produces industrial gases, electronic gases, and gas equipment.
The industrial gas producer marked Air Liquide’s original entry into the Korean market. The French firm later exited the market but has recently been looking to return.
DIG Airgas ranks third in Korea’s industrial gas market, producing high-purity gases used in semiconductors, medical applications, and industrial manufacturing—making it a strategic asset for global firms seeking exposure to Korea’s advanced manufacturing sector.
