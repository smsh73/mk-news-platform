South Korea’s top used car seller K Car Co. posted record quarterly revenue in the second quarter, driven by growing demand for like-new used vehicles.
According to a regulatory filing on Thursday, K Car posted 608.8 billion won ($438.8 million) in revenue for the April-June period, up 3.4 percent from the same period a year ago. Its operating profit stood at 18.1 billion won, up 0.1 percent.
Its revenue marked the highest on record for a single quarter.
Growth continued across both retail and auction segments, supported by higher average selling prices.
Retail sales volume dipped slightly due to weakened consumer sentiment amid political uncertainty, but demand for like-new used cars increased as new car prices climbed.
Sales of budget vehicles priced under 15 million won also remained solid.
In the auction segment, vehicle sales rose 7.9 percent year-on-year, fueled by stronger export demand. The rental car segment also maintained its upward trend.
K Car said its adoption of artificial intelligence for market forecasting improved operational efficiency by reducing inventory turnover days, contributing to earnings growth.
The company plans to reinforce its market position and product competitiveness through its online-merge-offline (OMO) strategy.
K Car expects deferred demand for used cars to recover gradually in the second half as political and social uncertainties ease.
It also plans to enhance profitability by refining AI-driven inventory management, diversifying procurement channels, and improving customer convenience.
“We will aim for long-term growth through an optimized product mix aligned with market trends and operational efficiency that balances profitability with turnover,” the company said.
