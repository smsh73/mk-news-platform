One in two micro business owners in South Korea reported higher sales following the government’s stimulus payments, a survey showed on Tuesday.
The Korea Federation of Micro Enterprises (KFME) announced on Tuesday that 55.8 percent of respondents saw sales rise after receiving the payments.
The online survey, conducted jointly with the Korea Merchant Association from August 5 to 7, covered 2,035 micro business owners in local commercial districts and traditional markets.
Among those reporting gains, 51 percent said sales rose by 10 to 30 percent.
By industry, wholesale businesses recorded the highest share of increased sales at 68.6 percent, followed by food and beverage businesses at 52.6 percent.
Foot traffic also improved, with 51.8 percent of respondents reporting more visitors.
Businesses’ overall satisfaction with the policy was high, with 75.5 percent saying the payments effectively encouraged the use of traditional markets and neighborhood shops. Also, 63 percent noted that the policy helped spur spending.
The respondents called for similar initiatives, with 70.1 percent favoring additional programs. They also suggested improvements such as limiting payment use to neighborhood businesses and increasing the amount provided.
