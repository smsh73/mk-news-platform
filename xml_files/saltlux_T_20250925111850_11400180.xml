The South Korean renewable energy industry is on high alert after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday (local time) that he would not approve wind and solar power projects.
“Any State that has built and relied on WINDMILLS and SOLAR for power are seeing RECORD BREAKING INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY AND ENERGY COSTS,” Trump wrote on his own social media platform, Truth Social.
He even called wind and solar power “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY” and declared that “the days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!”
Trump has consistently denounced and rejected renewable energy initiatives that were promoted by Democratic administrations, including that of former President Joe Biden.
The U.S. renewable energy sector has already been hit hard, with federal loan guarantees cut off, causing the country’s largest renewable energy transmission line project to collapse.
As Trump’s move to scrap green policies intensifies, Korean companies in the sector are scrambling to assess the uncertainty that that will create for their U.S. market strategies and local investment plans.
“We are monitoring the situation very closely,” an official from the Korean solar power industry said. “Trump’s claim that electricity bills are rising due to wind and solar power is not true. In fact, when calculated over the lifespan of generation facilities, renewable energy costs are steadily declining and are now at their lowest levels.”
