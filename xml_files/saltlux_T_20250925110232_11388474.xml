South Korea‘s antibody drug developer Y-Biologics has secured 35 billion won ($25.2 million) in research and development funding through a private placement of convertible bonds (CBs). The offering drew strong demand, recording an oversubscription from institutional investors including biotech-focused venture capital firms such as Aju IB Investment, DSC Investment, and Partners Investment.
The funds will be used to advance the company’s next-generation immuno-oncology pipeline based on its Multi-AbKine platform — a multi-antibody–cytokine fusion technology. Specifically, 15 billion won will go toward preclinical and clinical trial preparations for AR170, 9.5 billion won for AR166, and 3.5 billion won for AR153 and joint research projects.
AR170 is a triple-mechanism multi-antibody–cytokine fusion drug expected to provide a new treatment option for solid tumor patients resistant to existing PD-1 antibodies. AR166 similarly targets cancers with low PD-1 response rates, such as MSS-type colorectal cancer. AR153 is a next-generation antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting B7H3, designed as a precision therapy with reduced toxicity.
The company said the fresh funding will allow it to carry out its R&D schedule without delays, strengthen corporate value, and lay the groundwork for future technology transfers.
Y-Biologics has already secured 11.95 billion won in government grants, including 6.15 billion won from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy for an international joint development project and 5.8 billion won for a biotech cluster initiative.
“By leveraging the synergy between government support and private investment, we aim to accelerate entry into global clinical trials and pursue global commercialization of multi-antibody–based drugs,” a company official said.
