The United States has expanded its 50 percent tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to cover an additional 407 related products, raising concerns for South Korean exporters of goods ranging from refrigerators to cosmetics.
According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Monday, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced on Friday that the new items, which include machinery, auto parts, electronics, and packaging materials, will be subject to tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act.
The measures took effect for imports cleared through U.S. customs or released from bonded warehouses after Monday.
The Korea International Trade Association (KITA) estimated the newly targeted products represent $11.88 billion in exports to the U.S. Refrigerators and freezers accounted for the largest share at $1.604 billion, followed by cosmetics at $1.26 billion. Transformers, worth around $600 million, were also flagged as likely to be significantly impacted.
Cosmetics exports, in particular, could face new costs because some products use aluminum-heavy containers, officials said.
