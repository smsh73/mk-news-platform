Hyundai Motor Co. and Hyundai Steel Co. are under pressure from the ruling Democratic Party to drop damages lawsuits against striking workers, as the party pushes labor law amendments that would cap the amount companies can claim from unions.
According to industry sources on Thursday, the DP recently asked both companies to drop ongoing lawsuits against subcontracted workers. There are four such suits pending, including three involving Hyundai Motor over strikes in 2010, 2013 and 2023, and one involving Hyundai Steel over a 2021 strike.
The DP argues Hyundai Motor’s lawsuits have little practical merit, noting that key demands from the strikes, including converting all in-house subcontracted employees to regular positions, have already been met. Continuing to pursue the lawsuits, the party contends, serves no meaningful purpose.
The party maintains that such lawsuits undermine workers’ legitimate right to collective action and says voluntary withdrawal through labor management agreement before the legislative changes take effect would be preferable. The party also recently mediated Hanwha Ocean Co.’s 47 billion won damages suit against striking workers.
Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Steel said no decision has been made on withdrawing the lawsuits.
