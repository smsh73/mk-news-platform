A vast majority of South Korean economists believe the top priority for the incoming administration should be to boost the country’s potential growth rate by overhauling industrial structures and cultivating new growth engines, a recent survey showed.
The Korean Economic Association (KEA) surveyed 200 of its members between May 9 and May 19 on what the new government’s long-term economic policy priorities should be. The results of the survey were recently released.
Of the respondents, 168 economists, or 84 percent, chose “enhancing potential growth, industrial advancement, and discovering future growth drivers” as the most urgent agenda.
When asked to identify the fundamental structural issue facing the Korean economy, the most common response—selected by 142 economists (71 percent)—was a “slowdown in productivity, stagnation in technological innovation, and lack of new growth momentum.”
The results reflect widespread concern among experts about Korea’s stagnant industrial structure, declining productivity, and rapidly diminishing growth potential.
On the question of how the government should balance growth and income distribution, nearly half (49 percent) said the ratio should be 70:30 in favor of growth, while another 31.5 percent suggested a 60:40 split.
In total, four out of five respondents indicated that the new government should place greater emphasis on economic growth.
Regarding immediate priorities, 68 percent of respondents cited the need to support industrial transformation in response to rapid technological shifts such as artificial intelligence, while 64 percent pointed to addressing deindustrialization and protectionism stemming from U.S. tariffs and rising imports from China.
Nearly half (49.5 percent) of the economists surveyed said that the biggest shortcoming in Korea’s economic policymaking process is a lack of consistency and predictability.
As for the biggest economic risk the new government should avoid, 77 percent of respondents warned against fiscal populism and indiscriminate handouts.
