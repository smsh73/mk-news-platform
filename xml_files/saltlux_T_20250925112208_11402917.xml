LG CNS Co., an information technology services and solutions provider in South Korea, unveiled an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) ecosystem designed to enhance corporate productivity.
The company hosted the AX Media Day at LG Science Park in Magok, western Seoul, on Monday, where it introduced its enterprise AI platform AgenticWorks and its business innovation service AXthink.
“Agentic AI goes beyond simple repetitive tasks to actively analyze, coordinate, and support decision-making across entire workflows,” Hyun Shin-gyoon, president and chief executive officer of LG CNS, said. “By linking corporate systems with AI agents, we can ensure safe and sustainable operations.”
AgenticWorks is a modular platform that supports the entire lifecycle of AI services from design to operation and management. It compromises six core modules - Knowledge Repository for data preprocessing, Refiner for AI model enhancement, Builder for agent creation, Studio for a no-code development environment, Hub for system integration, and Router for optimal model selection. Companies can select only the features they need, enabling even non-technical employees to build AI services directly.
The platform is powered by LG CNS’s Data Analytics and AI Platform (DAP GenAI) and collaborative technologies from global AI firm Cohere, while also supporting multiple models that include EXAONE from the LG AI Research Institute.
“We tailor multiple models to client-specific needs and business characteristics,” a company spokesperson said.
LG CNS also introduced AXthink, a service that automates routine tasks such as scheduling, meetings, emails, and translations. The service analyzes each user’s work style and priorities to deliver personalized features.
When implemented at LG Display, AXthink improved productivity by 10 percent and saved over $10 billion annually compared to foreign solutions.
