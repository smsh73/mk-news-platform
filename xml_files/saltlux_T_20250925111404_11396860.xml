LG Electronics Inc. is accepting voluntary retirement applications from employees in its TV business unit, following a second-quarter operating loss and declining market share against rising Chinese competition.
According to industry sources on Monday, LG is offering the program to employees in its Media & Entertainment Solutions (MS) division who are over 50 or have posted poor performance for several years.
Eligible employees will receive severance pay equivalent to up to three years of salary based on tenure and remaining years until retirement, along with additional benefits such as education support for their children.
While LG Electronics has previously implemented similar voluntary retirements in 2022 and 2023 as part of internal workforce restructuring, analysts say this year’s program reflects mounting pressure from the struggling TV business.
The company is starting the process with the MS division, which oversees the TV segment.
The MS division posted an operating loss of 191.7 billion won ($138 million) in the April–June period. LG’s global market share in the TV segment has also slipped amid aggressive expansion by Chinese rivals, with some surveys ranking the company behind BOE and TCL in fourth place.
LG said last week that its average TV selling price in the first half of the year was down 2.5 percent from last year.
In response to this competitive squeeze, LG is diversifying its TV business, with its webOS smart TV platform playing a key role.
The ad-based platform, which provides content for free, is now used by over 600 global brands. WebOS revenue surpassed 1 trillion won last year and is expected to exceed 2 trillion won this year.
