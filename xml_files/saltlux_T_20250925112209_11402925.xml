SK hynix has achieved a breakthrough in next-generation NAND flash memory by successfully developing a chip capable of storing larger amounts of data. The company announced on Monday it began mass producing the world’s first 321-layer NAND product, surpassing the 300-layer milestone and reinforcing its technological leadership in ultra-high-density semiconductors.
The new chip is a 321-layer, 2-terabit (Tb) quad-level cell (QLC) NAND flash, which can store four bits per cell. NAND flash memory is a core component for storage devices used in smartphones, PCs, and data center servers. Performance and cost efficiency vary depending on how many bits are stored in each cell, evolving from single-level cell (SLC, 1 bit), to multi-level cell (MLC, 2 bits), triple-level cell (TLC, 3 bits), and now to QLC.
QLC technology has long been considered a significant hurdle in the industry due to its complexity, but SK hynix has now cleared that barrier. The new chip doubles capacity to 2Tb compared to the previous generation. To address potential slowdowns from higher density, the company increased the number of planes - the parallel processing units inside the chip - from four to six. As a result, data transfer speed doubled, write performance improved by up to 56 percent, and read performance rose by 18 percent. Power efficiency also improved by more than 23 percent, making the product well-suited for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.
SK hynix plans to first deploy the chip in solid-state drives (SSDs) for PCs, before expanding its applications to enterprise SSDs (eSSDs) for data centers and universal flash storage (UFS) for smartphones.
The company will also integrate its proprietary 32-die packaging (32DP) technology, which doubles storage density, strengthening its push into the ultra-high-capacity eSSD market even further.
Jeong Woo-pyo, head of NAND development at SK hynix, said, “We will meet the high-performance demands of the data center market and take a leap forward as a full-stack AI memory provider.”
