LG Electronics Inc. said Tuesday it will introduce 25 new appliances tailored to European consumers at IFA 2025 in Berlin, Germany, which opens on September 5. The lineup includes refrigerators and washing machines optimized for energy efficiency and eco-friendliness, areas of growing concern in Europe.
Amid soaring energy prices in the region, consumers have increasingly sought products that lower electricity bills. LG enhanced energy efficiency by redesigning key structures to better preserve cold air and advancing its “AI CoreTech,” which integrates artificial intelligence with motor and compressor technologies.
In refrigerators, LG strengthened insulation to reduce compressor operation, while AI optimizes usage patterns to further cut power consumption. Both bottom-freezer and French-door models have achieved industry-leading efficiency, slashing energy use compared with last year.
In washing machines, LG unveiled high-efficiency wash combo units, reflecting Europe’s early adoption of all-in-one washer-dryers. The company introduced the world’s first all-in-one washer-dryer with an A energy rating in Europe in 2021, topping the market with its LG Signature Heat Pump Wash Combo. Among the new products, bottom-freezer refrigerators and washing machines recorded energy efficiency ratings well above Europe’s A standard.
The designs and structures of the appliances have also been tailored to local needs. Based on in-home surveys and AI-driven usage data analysis, LG applied zero-clearance hinges to refrigerators, allowing doors to open fully even when installed flush against walls or cabinets. For French-door models, the company maintained width but increased height by about 80 millimeters to expand capacity, taking into account the average height of European consumers.
LG will also roll out app-based services and accessibility features.
The ThinQ app will provide a “self-check” mode for washers, enabling users to test drum motors and water systems without an expert. To support elderly and disabled customers, LG will launch the “LG Comfort Kit,” exclusively for Europe.
At IFA 2025, LG will present its theme, “LG AI Appliances Orchestra,” demonstrating how its AI home hub, ThinQ ON, connects appliances with external platforms to create an integrated AI home solution. Market tracker Statista projects the European appliance market will reach about 150 trillion won ($110.3 billion) in 2025, making it one of the world’s largest alongside North America, with annual growth of 4.1 percent expected through 2030.
