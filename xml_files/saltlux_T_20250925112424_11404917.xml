South Korean cosmetics manufacturers are aggressively entering the burgeoning Indian market, where demand for K-beauty is surging.
According to industry sources on Wednesday, India’s beauty and personal care market is projected to reach about $45 billion in 2030. The Korea Cosmetics Industry Institute noted in a report that the market reached about $31.7 billion in 2024.
Shifting beauty preferences in India toward a more natural look, away from sharp contours, bold brows and strong lips, are adding to the appeal of Korean products.
A report by Indian beauty platform Kindlife and research firm Datum Intelligence forecasts the India market for Korean cosmetics to grow from $400 million in 2024 to $1.5 billion in 2030.
With an annual growth rate of 25.9 percent, that pace is more than double the 12 percent growth forecast for India’s overall beauty and personal care market.
The number of Korean cosmetics buyers in India is also expected to rise from about 11.9 million in 2024 to more than 27 million by 2030, with monthly spending of 1,000 to 3,000 rupees ($11.41 to $34.22).
Kindlife noted India as an attractive market ready for development, where Korean beauty is becoming part of the culture instead of a short-lived craze.
Demographics are another tailwind.
About 47.5 percent of India’s 1.4 billion population are under 25, and the median age is 29, compared with 45 in Korea, 49 in Japan, 38 in the U.S., and 39 in China.
“Young people in India are already familiar with Korean pop stars and TV shows and are naturally developing an interest in Korean beauty,” an industry insider said. “India is emerging as a key market to secure early.”
Companies are stepping up accordingly.
Cosmetics original design manufacturing (ODM) giant Cosmax Inc. plans to set up a local subsidiary in Mumbai by year-end, starting with marketing and customer management and considering production facilities as it wins clients. The company has secured more than 50 Indian clients and received over 30 new product development inquiries this year.
Amorepacific Corp., which entered India in 2013 with Innisfree, is focusing on expanding distribution this year.
In April, it ran a large promotion to widen consumer reach and is also highlighting Laneige, Etude and Sulwhasoo.
Innisfree India posted sales of 11.7 billion won ($8.4 million) last year, up 58 percent from a year earlier.
LG H&H Co. is marketing Ohui, Su:m37˚, The History of Whoo, Belif and The Face Shop in India. The Face Shop, which entered India online in 2016, has been expanding into offline channels.
Independent brands are joining the push.
Craver Corp.’s Skin1004 launched on leading beauty platforms Tira and Nykaa, as well as Amazon, this year.
From January to July, India sales topped 4.6 billion won, up 345 percent year on year. Beauty of Joseon by Goodai Global Inc. and Anua by The Founders Inc. are also building recognition, primarily through online platforms.
