<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/21/news-p.v1.20250821.d3b1d72be13f4b41a6ae152f7818f509_P1.png' alt=' (Yonhap)'>
South Korean steel giant Posco announced Wednesday that it will establish its first corporate venture capital (CVC) fund worth 50 billion won ($36.76 million) to foster startups in future growth areas such as digital transformation (DX) and carbon reduction.
The steelmaker will contribute 40 billion won, with Posco Investment providing the remaining 10 billion won. The fund will be formally launched at an inaugural meeting scheduled for August 29.
A CVC is a venture capital vehicle set up by a non-financial corporation, designed not only for investment returns but also to create synergies with the company’s core businesses.
The Posco CVC No. 1 Fund will focus on startups with key technologies aligned with the group’s growth strategy, including DX, energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and renewable energy. About 20 percent of the fund will be allocated to promising overseas startups.
The fund will be managed by Posco Investment, which has strong expertise and understanding of Posco’s operations. Posco also plans joint R&D and pilot projects with investee companies, while directly adopting their products and technologies in its business divisions.
The move comes as Posco steps up efforts to build a startup ecosystem for future innovation. Through its in-house venture platform, the company has nurtured more than 20 startups, some of which have won innovation awards at global events such as CES 2025.
“This fund will strengthen cooperation with startups holding future-oriented technologies in areas like AI and decarbonization,” said a Posco official. “We will accelerate innovation in low-carbon, smart manufacturing processes and actively invest to secure sustainable new growth engines.“
