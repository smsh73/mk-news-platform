According to the Korea Exchange, the shares were trading at 12,700 won as of 9:24 a.m., up 12.69 percent from the previous session. The stock climbed as high as 14,650 won earlier in the session to set a new intraday high.
KOAS disclosed on August 22nd, 2025, that it will acquire 2.44 million shares of Novelty Nobility for around 15 billion won ($10.9 million), giving it a 14.3 percent stake. The share purchase is scheduled to be completed on September 8th, and the company said the purpose of the acquisition is to “maximize synergy between the two firms in connection with our planned entry into new drug development as well as the biopharma sector.”
