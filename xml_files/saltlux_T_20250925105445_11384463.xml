Despite reporting bottom-tier earnings in the second quarter, Samsung Electronics Co. is drawing growing optimism from securities analysts, who are raising their price targets on expectations of a rebound in its memory and foundry businesses.
According to FnGuide Inc. on Sunday, a total of 16 securities firms raised their target prices for Samsung Electronics following its confirmed earnings release.
KB Securities, Shinhan Investment, and IBK Investment & Securities raised their targets to 90,000 won ($64.9).
Samsung Electronics’ shares recently climbed above 70,000 won, fueled in part by reports that Samsung has secured a foundry deal with Tesla Inc.
Although the stock fell 3.5 percent on August 1, dipping back below the 70,000 won mark, investor attention remains fixed on the company’s long-term outlook.
Hana Securities also revised its earnings forecast, raising Samsung‘s 2025 operating profit estimate from 26.7 trillion won to 28.1 trillion won. It projected next year’s operating profit at 38.3 trillion won.
“From the second half of this year, Samsung’s performance will improve as one-off cost burdens in the memory and foundry sectors ease significantly,” said Kim Dong-won, an analyst at KB Securities.
Some analysts believe Samsung is regaining leadership in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and advanced foundry markets.
Noh Geun-chang, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities, said, “The downturn in HBM and foundry has likely bottomed out. The Tesla deal confirms Samsung’s value in sub-5nm processes and supports its credibility in the HBM space as well.”
