South Korea’s Woori Investment Securities Co. is expanding its investment banking business with the launch of a dedicated initial public offering (IPO) division.
According to industry sources on Tuesday, the brokerage has recently established an IPO unit under its corporate finance headquarters to target small and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking to go public.
The company is recruiting IPO specialists with deep knowledge of SME financing and plans to gradually roll out infrastructure for public offerings, including systems for retail subscription and compliance frameworks.
The move follows its acquisition of an investment banking license earlier this year and the launch of its mobile trading system (MTS) in March.
The firm has since broadened its business portfolio, marking its ambition to compete with more established players in Korea’s financial sector.
For the first half of 2025, Woori Investment Securities posted a net profit of 17.1 billion won ($12.3 million), bolstered by robust performance in the debt capital market, alternative investments, and securities trading and lending.
Its non-interest income reached 39.6 billion won during the cited period, underlining the firm’s growing reliance on investment banking and trading operations.
