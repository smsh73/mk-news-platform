South Korean power equipment stocks rose on Friday morning following news of Google LLC’s large-scale data center investment.
According to the Korea Exchange on Friday, LS ELECTRIC Co. shares were trading at 291,000 won ($209.91) as of 9:12 a.m., up 2.65 percent from the previous session. HD Hyundai Electric Co. shares rose 1.42 percent, while those of Cheil Electric Co. gained 1.01 percent and Hyosung Heavy Industries Corp. advanced 3.01 percent.
The gains came after Bloomberg reported that “Alphabet Inc.’s Google plans to invest an additional $9 billion in Virginia by 2026 to enhance its cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure.”
“This is the latest example of a series of Big Tech investments in U.S. data centers,” the report noted. “Google’s commitment to expanding AI infrastructure follows similar moves by Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.”
Northern Virginia, where Google announced its additional investment, has been nicknamed “Data Center Alley” as it has attracted large-scale investment since the initial stages of cloud infrastructure development in the early 2000s.
Meanwhile, Korean robot solutions provider ROBOTIS Inc. saw its shares fall on Friday morning after announcing a 100 billion won rights offering allocated to existing shareholders.
ROBOTIS shares were trading at 90,700 won as of 9:29 a.m. on Friday, down 3.10 percent from the previous session.
The company disclosed after market close on Thursday that it will proceed with the rights offering to raise funds for facilities and operations, issuing 0.1 new shares per one existing share.
“The rights issue is aimed at expanding production capacity for actuators (robotic motion control devices) to support the company’s plant expansion in Uzbekistan, and scaling up mass production is essential,” Kiwoom Securities Co. analyst Kim Hak-jun said.
Shinhan Securities Co. analyst Choi Seung-hwan added, “While concerns about share dilution are inevitable, the impact is expected to be short-lived and the company is likely to be revalued as a core player in the humanoid parts supply chain.”
LS ELECTRIC shares closed at 284,500 won, while ROBOTIS shares closed at 90,900 won.
