South Korean food exporters are adjusting their U.S. strategies as the newly concluded Korea-U.S. trade agreement sets a 15 percent reciprocal tariff rate, effectively forcing price hikes on popular products.
According to industry sources on Thursday, Samyang Foods, which does not have a U.S.-based production facility, plans to raise prices for some of its products sold in the U.S., including its flagship Buldak spicy noodles. The company is currently in discussions with major U.S. retailers like Walmart and Costco to finalize the scale of the increase.
In response to the higher tariff burden, Samyang Foods has formed a dedicated task force and is working closely with its U.S. subsidiary to explore various contingency plans.
The company’s exposure to the U.S. market is significant: overseas sales accounted for 77.3 percent of its 1.72 trillion won ($1.26 billion) in total revenue last year, with U.S. operations contributing $280 million, or roughly 28 percent.
“While it’s a relief that the deal puts Korea on equal footing with key competitors, raising prices is unavoidable,” a company official said.
