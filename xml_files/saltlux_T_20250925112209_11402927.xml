South Korean shipbuilding and inter-Korean economic cooperation stocks moved in opposite directions during early trading on Tuesday, despite discussions of cooperation at the summit between President Lee Jae-myung and U.S. President Donald Trump.
According to the Korea Exchange, Good People stock was trading at 2,555 won ($1.88) at 9:10 a.m., up 1.39 percent from the previous day. The company, a former tenant of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, is considered a representative inter-Korean economic cooperation stock. Other related stocks such as Ananti (up 2.27 percent), J. Estina (up 1.94 percent), and Ilshin Stone (up 1.99 percent) also rose.
In contrast, shipbuilding stocks showed a downward trend. Hanwha Ocean shares fell 2.96 percent, while those for HD Hyundai Heavy Industries dropped 2.26 percent and HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering declined 4.08 percent. Samsung Heavy Industries, however, saw its shares inch up 0.75 percent.
Although both shipbuilding and inter-Korean cooperation were mentioned at the White House summit the previous day, shipbuilding stocks failed to find fresh momentum, likely due to their earlier classification as beneficiaries of tariff negotiations. The KOSPIâ€™s weak performance on Tuesday also weighed on the sector.
Samsung Heavy Industries stock rose on news that it had signed a memorandum of understanding with Vigor Marine Group to establish a strategic partnership for U.S. Navy support ship maintenance, shipyard modernization, and joint shipbuilding.
Meanwhile, inter-Korean cooperation stocks gained ground after Trump reiterated his intention to push for an early summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Separately, domestic pen brand Monami saw its stock jump more than 10 percent after Trump praised and the pen used by Lee to sign the guestbook at the White House on Monday and then received as a gift. Monami shares were trading at 2,220 won as of 9:36 a.m. on Tuesday, up 12.01 percent from the previous day.
Good People shares closed at 2,345 won, while Monami shares closed at 2,575 won.
