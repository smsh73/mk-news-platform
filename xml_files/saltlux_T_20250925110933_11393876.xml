Since August 2015, Kim Jeong-ho, a member of Samsung Electronics’ ESG & Smart Factory Support Center, has visited more than 80 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to drive smart factory innovation. Based in Gumi, he has supported about seven companies a year across various industries in the Yeongnam region.
Specializing in on-site innovation execution, Kim works with in-house task forces (TFs) and Samsung team members to develop ideas and apply them directly to equipment and processes—an execution-focused approach.
“There’s no point in ending with a PowerPoint presentation in the meeting room,” Kim said. “You have to get out on the floor, move your body, and test ideas in practice to complete them.”
On-site, he prioritizes changes that may seem minor but are immediately felt by workers. Examples include improving the way corrugated cardboard is fed into machines at a packaging company, building ladders and safety devices, and installing mirrors to eliminate forklift blind spots—low-cost measures that improve both safety and efficiency.
“Small improvements build up until the owner and employees recognize the need for change, and that’s the starting point for innovation,” Kim noted. “What companies ultimately want from consulting is actionable change.”
Kim cites the CEO’s determination as the most critical factor in a successful smart factory transition.
“When the CEO decides to commit, it becomes part of the company culture,” he said. “Then employees naturally get involved, and Samsung staff also feel more motivated.”
He added that Samsung differentiates itself by not just installing systems, but also providing on-site mentoring. His principle is to work as if he were part of the site team—adjusting equipment, installing safety devices, and personally checking workers’ day-to-day pain points on the line.
