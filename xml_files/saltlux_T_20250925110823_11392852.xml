SK hynix Inc.’s head pledged to ensure that employees receive performance-based bonuses on a regular basis, addressing concerns that have fueled recent labor-management tensions.
Speaking at an internal communication event, “The Communication,” on Tuesday, SK hynix Chief Executive Officer and President Kwak Noh-Jung drew on the company’s past to frame his message. He referenced a 2011 television commercial that depicted a pine forest alongside the slogans “Growing densely without hindrance” and “Growing together without conflict.”
The ad was aired as the company emerged from creditor control to promote an image of sustainable growth and mutual prosperity.
The CEO’s comments come as management and the union remain divided over the performance bonus. The company has offered to distribute up to 10 percent of operating profit, while the union insists on the full 10 percent.
On the business front, Kwak noted that DRAM production capacity has improved significantly compared with the past but said further expansion appears necessary to meet demand.
