Samsung Electronics Co. on Tuesday launched its Micro RGB display, which uses red, green, and blue (RGB) LEDs as individual light sources that emit light directly.
The launch is aimed at widening the gap with Chinese companies in the LCD segment through differentiated next-generation advanced technology.
“Micro RGB achieves unprecedented precision in the control of micrometer-sized RGB LEDs, raising the bar for color accuracy and contrast in consumer displays,” said Son Tae-yong, executive vice president and head of the R&D Team of the Visual Display Business at Samsung Electronics. “With this launch, we’re setting the standard in the large-sized, ultra-premium TV market and reinforcing our commitment to next-generation display innovation.”
The RGB concept isn’t new — Chinese company Hisense Co. debuted RGB TVs earlier this year using mini-LED technology.
Samsung Electronics, however, said its version uses micro-LED chips less than 100 micrometers in size, enabling sharper, more vivid colors.
The company added that its Micro RGB TVs achieve full BT2020 color gamut coverage, a benchmark set by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), and have been certified by UL for “glare-free” viewing even in bright daylight.
Samsung Electronics demonstrated the new models at its showroom in Seoul, comparing them with conventional LCD TVs to highlight stronger color reproduction and higher clarity — qualities that put them in direct competition with OLED TVs.
The sets also feature AI-driven tools such as the Bixby voice assistant and a “Click to Search” function for on-screen content queries.
