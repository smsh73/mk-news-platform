Sixteen South Korean business leaders accompanied President Lee Jae-myung on his first Korea-U.S. summit as part of the economic delegation, with goals to expand investment in the United States.
Samsung Electronics Co. Chairman Jay Y. Lee was accompanied by key executives including Vice Chairman Chung Hyun-ho, who heads the business support task force and is the de facto group chief financial officer, with the unusual inclusion fueling speculation of a major group-wide investment decision. Other senior executives traveling included Kim Won-kyung, president and head of global public affairs at Samsung Electronics, Samsung C&T Corp. CEO Oh Se-chul, and Samsung Heavy Industries Co. CEO Choi Sung-an, suggesting potential commitments not only in semiconductors but in shipbuilding as well. Samsung may also announce new investment in the bio sector.
SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won plans to expand U.S. investments in semiconductors, batteries, and energy. SK hynix Inc. is building a $3.87 billion high-bandwidth memory packaging plant in Indiana, while SK on Co. is broadening its U.S. battery operations through its standalone Georgia facility and joint ventures with U.S. automakers. Energy affiliate SK innovation E&S, which is already active in North American liquefied natural gas projects, is considering expanding further.
Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chairman Euisun Chung, who is currently overseas, is expected to join the delegation shortly. Hyundai has committed $21 billion in U.S. investment by 2028, including $8.6 billion to raise its U.S. vehicle production capacity to 1.2 million units annually as well as adding new Kia and Genesis lines. Affiliate Hyundai Steel Co. is building a $5.8 billion electric arc furnace steel mill in Louisiana with an annual capacity of 2.7 million tons.
LG Group Chairman Koo Kwang-mo aims to strengthen investments in batteries and home appliances. Currently operating plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee, LG Energy Solution Ltd. is also constructing new standalone factories in Michigan and Arizona.
Hanwha Group Vice Chairman Kim Dong-kwan is expected to focus on expanding the Philly Shipyard, a core element of the Make American Shipbuilding Great Again (MASGA) project. He is reviewing modernization and dock expansion plans, which are expected to be discussed during the summit.
HD Hyundai Co. Executive Vice Chairman Chung Ki-sun is arranging meetings with U.S. officials. The company will sign the first MASGA project agreement with Korea Development Bank and U.S. private equity fund Cerberus Frontier, which owns the Subic shipyard in the Philippines, on Monday (local time). HD Hyundai plans to provide technology support and workforce training to U.S. shipbuilders as well as carrying out shipbuilding and maintenance, repair, and overhaul work at Subic.
LS Group Chairman Koo Ja-eun is considering a visit to U.S. power equipment and cable facilities as part of a $3 billion five-year investment plan to expand capacity, while Doosan Enerbility Co. Chairman Park Gee-won will advance the companyâ€™s small modular reactor project with U.S. partner NuScale Power Corp.
CJ Group Chairman Lee Jay-hyun is likely to expand the groupâ€™s U.S. food operations with the company investing $550 million in a South Dakota plant scheduled to begin operations in 2027 and completing a 90,000-square-meter factory in Georgia this year.
Naver Corp. CEO Choi Soo-yeon will seek artificial intelligence collaboration opportunities with U.S. firms during the Korea-U.S. business roundtable, while Korea Zinc Inc. Chairman Choi Yoon-beom will discuss supply chain cooperation with U.S. officials for critical minerals such as antimony, which Washington considers strategically important.
