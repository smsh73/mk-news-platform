Key growth indicators for South Korea’s listed midsize companies weakened in the first quarter of 2025, according to a report released on Monday.
In its Q1 2025 Management Analysis of Listed Midsize Companies, the Federation of Middle Market Enterprises of Korea said that revenue growth for these firms reached 1.3 percent in the first quarter, down 2.2 percentage points from a year earlier.
Total asset growth also slowed to 3.8 percent, a 2.4 percentage point decline from the same period last year.
The findings are based on financial data from 992 listed midsize enterprises.
By sector, the non-manufacturing industries posted a more pronounced decline.
Revenue growth in non-manufacturing stood at just 0.8 percent, down 8.8 percentage points from the previous year. Total asset growth also dropped 5.2 percentage points to 2.9 percent.
In contrast, the manufacturing sector showed slightly improved performance, with revenue growth rising 0.5 percentage point to 1.5 percent.
However, its total asset growth still declined by 1.1 percentage points to 4.2 percent.
In terms of financial stability, corporate borrowing increased.
The debt-to-asset ratio of midsize companies rose to 13 percent, up 0.3 percentage points from the previous year.
“The past year has clearly seen a deterioration in business conditions for midsize enterprises,” said Lee Ho-joon, executive vice chairman of the Federation. “It is time for coordinated policy support and stronger public-private cooperation to restore vitality to the sector.”
