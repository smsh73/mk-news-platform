South Korea’s largest fashion platform Musinsa began the process of selecting lead underwriters for its planned initial public offering, it said on Monday.
The company sent requests for proposals (RFPs) to a group of major domestic and international securities firms, including NH Investment & Securities, Mirae Asset Securities, Samsung Securities, Shinhan Investment, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and UBS. While the company has not finalized a listing date or offering size, it is reportedly considering both domestic and U.S. stock exchanges.
Investment banking sources estimate Musinsa’s corporate value at around 10 trillion won ($7.35 billion), with the IPO expected to raise more than 1 trillion won. Given the timeline, the offering is likely to take place in 2026 at the earliest.
Founded in 2001 as an online sneaker enthusiast forum – with a name that is an abbreviation of “a place with a ton of sneaker photos” - Musinsa evolved into a full-fledged fashion e-commerce platform. CEO Cho Man-ho launched the online community ‘Musinsa.com’ in 2003 and opened the Musinsa Store in 2009 to begin selling fashion items directly. The company was incorporated in 2012 and launched its private label, Musinsa Standard, in 2017.
Musinsa Standard recorded over 100 billion won in annual revenue by 2020 and entered the offline market in 2021 with its first store near Hongik University in Seoul, with Musinsa currently operating 29 offline stores. The company reported a total transaction volume of 4.5 trillion won, consolidated revenue of 1.24 trillion won, and operating profit of 102.8 billion won in 2024.
