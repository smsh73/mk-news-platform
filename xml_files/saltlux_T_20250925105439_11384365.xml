Hyundai Green Food Co., a comprehensive food company affiliated with South Korean retailer Hyundai Department Store Group, announced plans to expand its lineup of medifood for patients with rare and chronic diseases by more than 70 percent from the current 247 items to 430.
Medifood refers to convenient meals tailored to specific diseases, formulated by adjusting nutritional content to meet the dietary requirements defined by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.
The company announced on Sunday that it will significantly increase the number of its Medifood meal plans to 430 by 2028 and launch its first line of premium frozen ready-to-eat meals designed not only for patients but also for those at risk of developing illnesses or with a family history of disease this year.
The medifood market is still considered an emerging sector in Korea.
According to the food ministry, the market grew from 80 billion won ($57.61 million) in 2018 to 267 billion won in 2023.
Industry sources estimate that Hyundai Green Food holds over 50 percent of the Korean medifood market share.
“We have seen our medifood sales grow by double digits every year since launching the line in 2022,” a company official said. Its sales rose by 18 percent in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period a year ago.
