The South Korean government and the country’s steel making giant POSCO have won a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Commerce, which imposed countervailing duties on the grounds that “Korea’s electricity rates are low and therefore constitute a subsidy.”
Countervailing duties are tariffs imposed by an importing country equivalent to the amount of subsidies when an exporting country subsidizes certain industries to enable them to export products at below-market prices.
According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) on Monday, local time, ruled in favor of Korea in a case where POSCO was the plaintiff and the Korean government participated as a third party.
The U.S. Department of Commerce determined in December 2023 that Korea’s electricity rates constituted a subsidy due to being supplied at low prices.
On that basis, the department imposed a 0.87 percent countervailing duty rate on POSCO’s carbon alloy steel plate, claiming that “specificity” existed as the steel industry disproportionately consumes more electricity.
The Korean government and POSCO filed a lawsuit with the CIT in February 2024, challenging the department’s determination.
The CIT ruled that the steel industry’s high electricity consumption alone does not establish disproportionality.
In particular, it cited precedent from December 2024, when Korea won a similar case involving general steel plates.
The government had secured a first-instance victory in a lawsuit over countervailing duties imposed by the U.S. department on Hyundai Steel Co.’s general plate products.
The U.S. department must revise its determination regarding the “specificity” of electricity rates within 60 days of the latest ruling and resubmit it to the CIT.
