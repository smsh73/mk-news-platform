South Korea’s major hypermarket chains are racing to strengthen their quick commerce offerings.
Emart Inc., the e-commerce unit of Shinsegae Group, announced on Thursday that it will roll out its BaroQuick one-hour delivery service across 19 Emart stores nationwide, including 12 in Seoul, starting September 1.
By leveraging its extensive network of physical outlets as urban logistics hubs, Emart aims to enhance delivery competitiveness and attract more online demand. The service will initially cover stores in Seoul, Chungcheong, Daegu, and Busan. BaroQuick uses motorcycles operated by delivery partners to deliver orders within a three-kilometer radius of each store. Customers can order from about 6,000 designated products on the SSG app, with the range set to expand further.
Emart identified rapid delivery as a core strategy at its annual shareholders’ meeting in March and has since accelerated investments in quick commerce.
It began quick commerce in November 2024 at Wangsimni and Guro branches through Baemin, later expanding to 55 stores in just 10 months. Now, with the new rollout on SSG.com, 19 more stores have been added to the service network.
Industry officials note that quick commerce aligns well with hypermarkets’ strength in fresh food, allowing consumers to receive groceries and discount items within an hour without visiting stores. This strategy could help large retailers recapture demand lost to online platforms during years of sluggish domestic consumption.
Homeplus and Lotte Mart are also bolstering their quick commerce strategies. Homeplus, which launched the service with Baemin in April, announced it will expand participating stores from six to 41 this month alone.
Lotte Mart currently operates timed delivery slots three to four times per day at 64 stores nationwide through its Lotte Mart Zeta app, recently adding a subscription service called Zeta Pass, which offers unlimited free delivery for orders over 15,000 won ($10.8) at a monthly fee of 2,900 won.
“Quick commerce creates synergy with hypermarkets’ advantage in fresh food. While offline stores missed opportunities during Coupang’s rocket delivery boom, they can now regain online demand through store-based delivery,” said an industry official.
