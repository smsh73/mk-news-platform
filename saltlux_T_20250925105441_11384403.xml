South Korea’s antitrust agency has decided to impose the largest-ever compliance penalty on Asiana Airlines Inc. for exceeding the fare increase limit set by regulatory authorities after its merger with Korean Air Lines Co., the country’s flag carrier and largest airline.
The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) announced on Sunday that it will fine Asiana Airlines 12.1 billion won ($8.71 million) for violating the merger condition prohibiting average fare increases beyond a certain threshold.
As part of the merger approval, authorities had stipulated that average ticket prices must not increase beyond the inflation rate compared to 2019, to prevent fare hikes resulting from the airline’s strengthened market dominance.
This condition applies until the end of 2034.
However, Asiana Airlines exceeded the approved limits by 1.3 percent to 28.2 percent on various routes, including business class seats on flights from Incheon to Barcelona, Frankfurt, and Rome, and economy class seats to Rome and between Gwangju and Jeju.
The excess fares collected amounted to 680 million won.
The KFTC determined that the airline violated the measure from the outset and imposed a record-breaking compliance penalty.
It also decided to refer the company for criminal prosecution, given the seriousness of the case.
Asiana Airlines asserted that the violation was unintentional and attributed it to errors in a newly implemented fare management system.
“We made efforts to lower the average fare in the first quarter after discovering in February that we had been charging higher fares on nine routes,” the airline said.
It pledged to return a total of 3.15 billion won in value to consumers.
This includes 1 billion won in electronic vouchers for all passengers on the four routes with excess fares; special discount promotions worth 770 million won on three international routes; distribution of 50,000 discount coupons worth 20,000 won each (totaling 1 billion won) for all routes; and 380 million won worth of promotional fares on popular routes such as London and Istanbul.
