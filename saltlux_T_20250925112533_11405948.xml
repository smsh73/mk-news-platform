SK nexilis, the copper foil subsidiary of South Korea‘s SKC Co., has expanded its ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against Solus Advanced Materials Co. in the Unites States, to include allegations of trade secret misappropriation.
The company said on Friday that it filed a second amended complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas earlier this month.
In the new filing, SK nexilis sought additional liability claims under the Defend Trade Secrets Act (DTSA) and the Texas Uniform Trade Secrets Act (TUTSA), arguing that Solus and its affiliates misappropriated proprietary information related to additive recipes, electrolyte operating conditions, and drum management methods—considered core to copper foil production.
SK nexilis added that these trade secrets represented key competitive strengths developed through years of research and significant investment.
The company said that it is seeking remedies including an injunction to prevent further use of its trade secrets, compensation for actual damages and unjust enrichment, and punitive damages. It also indicated its intention to substantiate the claims and damages through court proceedings.
Solus Advanced Materials has maintained that the patents at issue are invalid, arguing that they were based on technologies already in the market and therefore lack originality. The company added that it would demonstrate in court that the patent claims themselves are unclear.
The dispute is also expanding to Europe. Shortly after the second amended filing in the U.S., SK nexilis filed two lawsuits with the Unified Patent Court (UPC), alleging that copper foil products sold in Europe by Solus affiliates infringed its patents. The company requested a comprehensive injunction, seeking to halt the manufacture, use, and sale of the accused products, as well as the recall and disposal of inventory already in distribution.
In Korea, SK nexilis currently holds the upper hand in related litigation.
On Wednesday, the Korean Intellectual Property Trial and Appeal Board (IPTAB) ruled that four patents held by Solus were invalid. These patents were part of six disputed in domestic lawsuits filed by Solus against SK nexilis, with the remaining two cases still under review.
