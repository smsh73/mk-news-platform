Nongshim announced on Thursday that it will release a special limited edition ramyun set inspired by the Netflix animation “K-Pop Demon Hunters.”
The collaboration, which began on August 20, gained attention after the HUNTR/X members in the animation were shown eating cup noodles resembling Nongshim products.
The special set features Shin Ramyun cups adorned with the main characters Rumi, Mira, and Zoey, with two cups per character for a total of six cups per set.
Sales of the 1,000 sets will begin at 10 a.m. on August 29 via the Nongshim Mall reservation page. Customers who participate in the review event will receive a Nongshim gift set.
The company said that it would continue to engage with ‘K-Pop Demon Hunters’ fans through activities that promote the Nongshim brand.
From the end of this month for approximately one month, Nongshim will hold a showcase of collaboration products featuring “K-Pop Demon Hunters” character designs, including Shin Ramyun and Shrimp Chips, at major retailers nationwide.
