The South Korean government is pushing ahead with a roadmap to phase out plastic as a national policy initiative.
The roadmap is expected to include directions for regulating single-use products and strategies for plastic recycling throughout its entire lifecycle.
According to political sources on Wednesday, the Ministry of Environment recently submitted a detailed plan to the presidential policy planning committee. The plastic phase-out roadmap is a key campaign pledge from President Lee Jae-myung.
The plan focuses on improving environmental sustainability across the entire plastic recycling chain by moving beyond a narrow emphasis on recycling rates alone.
It also outlines a framework for reviewing and organizing existing policies on single-use plastics.
“The roadmap aims to bring consistency to single-use plastic regulations by implementing feasible past proposals and developing alternatives for overly ambitious ones,” said a government official.
Korea’s plastic policy has shifted between administrations.
Initiatives introduced under the previous Moon Jae-in government, such as plastic straw bans, packaging restrictions, and a deposit system for single-use cups, were delayed or shelved under former President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The cup deposit system, initially planned for nationwide rollout, is now left to local governments, with only Sejong and Jeju implementing it so far.
For alternative straw materials, the Ministry of Environment is currently conducting a life cycle assessment (LCA).It is also working with the logistics industry to develop solutions for excessive packaging.
The deposit-refund system for transparent PET bottles, a campaign pledge by President Lee, is reportedly not being considered for full-scale implementation.
The government cites the need for further review, including the cost of installing unmanned collection machines, the program’s effectiveness, and potential inconvenience to consumers. PET bottles account for only about 5 percent of total plastic use.
Lawmakers are also active in supporting full life-cycle plastic policies.
Representative Lee Yong-woo of the Democratic Party, a member of the Environment and Labor Committee, stressed policies that reduce environmental impact across the entire plastic life cycle, from recycled and bio-based production to eco-friendly consumption, separation, and recycling.
