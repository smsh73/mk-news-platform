HMM Co. is accelerating the expansion of its bulk carrier business, signaling a strategic shift after the recent collapse of acquisition talks with SK shipping Co.
According to industry sources on Monday, HMM is actively pursuing the purchase of individual bulk carriers to support long-term shipping contracts.
“We plan to reduce the share of container ships and diversify our fleet to better manage market uncertainties,” an HMM official said.
A bulk carrier is a cargo ship designed to transport unpackaged goods such as grain, coal, and iron ore directly in its holds.
In May, HMM signed a 10-year transport contract worth $462 million with Brazilian mining company Vale SA, requiring three bulk carriers. With another large contract expected soon, the company plans to secure two additional vessels, bringing the total to five.
HMM currently operates one bulk carrier and recently bought a secondhand vessel, with three more secondhand ships under negotiation. Each costs between 50 billion won ($35.9 million) and 60 billion won. The shift from acquiring an entire business unit to buying ships individually is expected to drive continued aggressive purchases.
Acquiring vessels directly allows faster investment decisions, as only the ships needed for the size and duration of specific contracts are purchased. This approach avoids the complex integration and debt risks associated with business acquisitions, enabling the company to focus on vessel operations and expansion.
The company aims to strengthen its long-term contract–based business model, which offers stable revenue, and diversify from its container ship–centric structure into bulk carriers, car carriers, and other segments to secure future growth.
HMM plans to expand its bulk carrier fleet from 46 vessels as of June to about 110 by 2030, investing a total of 5.6 trillion won.
“Bulk carriers, unlike container ships, have less volatile contract rates and are relatively easier to secure on long-term deals,” the HMM official said. “With shipping rates down sharply this year and next year’s outlook also weak, increasing the bulk carrier share can help stabilize earnings.”
The SK shipping acquisition collapsed due to a wide gap in price expectations. Hahn & Co., SK shipping’s largest shareholder, reportedly sought around 2 trillion won, while HMM’s offer was in the 1.2 trillion to 1.3 trillion won range.
