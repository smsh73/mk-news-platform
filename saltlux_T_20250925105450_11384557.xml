<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/04/news-p.v1.20250804.1638924a85e34fd1a96d9da949eb2f54_P1.jpg' alt=' (DB HiTek)'>
South Korean contract chip manufacturer DB HiTek Co. said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its preliminary operating profit for the second quarter stood at 73.9 billion won ($53.27 million), up 10 percent from the same period a year ago.
Sales were 337.4 billion won during the April-to-June period, up 13 percent, while operating margin stood at 22 percent.
The strong performance is attributed to growing demand for power semiconductors and increased sales in applications such as telecommunications, automotive, and industrial sectors.
“Our capacity utilization rate recovered to the high-90 percent range in the first half of the year, and we expect a similar level in the second half despite continued uncertainties,” a company official said. “We will continue to strengthen our technological competitiveness, particularly in our core product - power semiconductors - while also focusing on new business initiatives to secure a solid foundation for future growth.”
DB HiTek, which entered the system semiconductor foundry (contract manufacturing) business in 2001 as the first in Korea, is considered a leading small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), having achieved nearly 50 percent operating margin in 2022 and consistently maintaining over 20 percent margins over the past decade.
In particular, its flagship Bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) technology for power semiconductors offers industry-leading competitiveness in power efficiency, yield, delivery time, and cost.
DB Hitek is scheduled to hold a two-day investor relations (IR) session for Korean institutional investors on September 4 and 5 to present its second-quarter business performance.
