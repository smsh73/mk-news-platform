South Korea’s fashion industry struggled in the second quarter as major players posted weak results amid sluggish demand and abnormal weather.
According to industry sources on Monday, Samsung C&T Corp.’s fashion division recorded sales of 510 billion won ($366 million) in the second quarter, down 0.6 percent from the same period a year ago. Its operating profit stood at 33 billion won, down 36 percent.
F&F Co., operator of brands like MLB and Discovery, also saw sales decline 3.2 percent to 378.9 billion won and operating profit fall 8.5 percent to 84 billion won.
Handsome Co., the fashion arm of Hyundai Department Store Group, reported sales of 338.1 billion won, down 1.1 percent, and operating profit of 700 million won, down 82.0 percent.
Shinsegae International Inc. also saw sales fall 3.8 percent year-on-year to 308.6 billion won in the second quarter, with an operating loss of 2.3 billion won.
Kolon Industries Inc.’s FnC division (Kolon FnC) posted a 9.2 percent drop in sales to 296.4 billion won and a 53.4 percent decline in operating profit to 7.5 billion won.
“Consumers seemed to cut spending on clothing in times of weak economy,” said an industry insider.
Statistics Korea data show the retail sales index for the second quarter stood at 101.8, down 0.2 percent from a year earlier. Clothing sales fell 1.6 percent.
A survey by the Korea Federation of Textile Industries on spring 2025 fashion consumption (March–May) found spending on fashion products down 8.2 percent year-on-year to 26.9 trillion won.
Fashion companies are eyeing overseas markets for growth.
Samsung C&T is accelerating the global rollout of its in-house brand 8 Seconds. It opened the second store in Manila in July and is preparing a third, with plans to partner with Philippine retail giant Suyen Corp.
F&F is promoting MLB and Discovery in China and other markets through new stores and local marketing. It is also pursuing the acquisition of TaylorMade, one of the world’s top three golf brands.
Handsome has chosen Paris as its global expansion hub, showcasing its brands at Paris Fashion Week and negotiating entry into leading international department stores.
Shinsegae International, which is strengthening its beauty portfolio alongside overseas expansion, is already seeing results.
Amuse, a brand it acquired last year, posted first-half sales of 19.9 billion won, up 57.8 percent, and operating profit of 2.4 billion won, up 167 percent.
Amuse’s consolidation boosted Shinsegae International’s beauty division to its highest-ever quarterly sales.
Amuse expanded its distribution network in Japan, launched market-specific products, and secured placement in about 3,000 variety and drugstores nationwide.
In the second half, it plans to enter the Middle East, Australia, Southeast Asia, Russia, and Mongolia.
“With consumer sentiment expected to recover, fashion spending should gradually pick up in the second half,” said another industry official. “Global strategies could help build momentum for an earnings rebound.”
