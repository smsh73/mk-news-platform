Chinese solar panels are gaining a foothold in the South Korean market, sparking industry concerns as imports continue to surge in line with the government’s renewable energy drive.
According to data from the Korea Customs Service, obtained by the office of Representative Cho Eun-hee of the People Power Party on Monday, imports of Chinese solar panels nearly doubled over the past four years, rising to 150,907 tons in 2024 from 76,161 tons in 2021.
In the first half of this year, import volume reached 97,851 tons, already exceeding the entire volume for 2023 at 94,647 tons.
Chinese products accounted for 99.6 percent of Korea’s total solar panel imports.
The influx of Chinese panels has paralleled the government’s push to expand renewable energy generation, which last year accounted for 10.4 percent of the national energy mix, marking the first time the share reached double digits.
Installed solar power capacity stood at 27.1 gigawatts (GW) as of the end of 2024.
Despite the expansion, domestic manufacturers have been losing ground.
Woongjin Energy, once the country’s sole producer of solar ingots and wafers, was declared bankrupt in 2022 after losing competitiveness to Chinese rivals benefiting from lower electricity costs and cheaper labor.
The company, which had the capacity to produce 2,000 megawatts of ingots and wafers annually, was unable to service its debts.
It received a court ruling discontinuing bankruptcy proceedings in June 2025. Its Daejeon plant was sold earlier this year to a local biotechnology company.
Industry insiders caution that continued dominance by Chinese suppliers could leave the renewable energy sector vulnerable to supply chain disruptions akin to the urea-water solution crisis.
With the domestic solar industry ecosystem already dismantled and the market effectively monopolized by Chinese producers, any price hikes or strategic supply restrictions could significantly increase Korea’s dependence on China for energy security.
“Pursuing renewable energy expansion without securing alternatives to Chinese-made components risks exposing the entire energy sector to systemic vulnerabilities,” Cho said.
The lawmaker called for urgent measures to diversify supply sources, boost the share of domestically produced components, and strengthen the foundation for industrial self-reliance as part of a broader energy security strategy.
