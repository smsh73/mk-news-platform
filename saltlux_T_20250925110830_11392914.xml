South Korea’s leading fashion platform Musinsa is ramping up its presence in the beauty segment through its subsidiary 29CM, which has seen strong growth driven by curated marketing content and targeted campaigns.
According to the company, transaction volume in the beauty category on 29CM more than doubled in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year.
The increase is attributed to a steady rollout of new product lines and monthly themed promotions, such as “Beauty Forecast of the Month.”
According to a company representative, 29CM surpassed 1 trillion won ($741 million) in total transactions last year, establishing itself as a top fashion platform for women in their 20s and 30s. The same demographic has fueled the success of its expanding beauty offerings in 2025.
As part of its strategy, 29CM launched a new content series titled “29 Beauty Routine,” which combines video interviews with well-known figures and promotional sales events.
The first video, released on Tuesday, features veteran model Shin Hyun-ji demonstrating her daily beauty regimen. In the clip, Shin emphasizes the importance of maintaining peak condition by first “washing off accumulated fatigue,” as she casually showcases hair care and fragrance products.
The campaign spotlights six cosmetic brands currently trending on 29CM. Each has partnered with the platform to offer discounts and visibility through the campaign.
