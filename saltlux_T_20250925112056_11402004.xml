<body><![CDATA[<img src='https://wimg.mk.co.kr/news/cms/202508/25/news-p.v1.20250825.45553aa355804541a4285332978f3dd8_P1.png' alt=''>
Hyundai Motor Group (HMG) will expand the hydrogen value chain beyond fuel cell vehicles to include ships, trams, and building-use hydrogen fuel cells, according to Ken Ramirez, executive vice president and head of HMG’s Energy & Hydrogen Business Division.
Ramirez’s remarks aimed to emphasize the scalability of hydrogen applications during an interview with Maeil Business Newspaper on Friday. He also expressed his determination to make the South Korean auto giant “a global leader in the energy transition by providing integrated solutions that connect hydrogen with other eco-friendly energy sources.”
Ramirez is a mobility expert who spent 17 years at the Renault-Nissan Group beginning in 2002. He joined HMG in 2021, serving as chief executive officer (CEO) of its Brazil and Latin America operations when he oversaw strategies to target emerging markets.
He was appointed executive vice president of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business Division for Hyundai Motor Co. in 2023, with his title changing to head of HMG Energy & Hydrogen Business Division earlier in 2025,.
Ramirez envisions diverse applications for hydrogen energy.
“We are positioning hydrogen’s advantages as an energy carrier as a key pillar of our future energy strategy,” he said.
Unlike electricity, which has limitations when transported along long distances via transport methods such as ships or vehicles, hydrogen can be stored and transported over long distances using ships and railways.
By leveraging this, he said Hyundai plans to provide integrated solutions - converting renewable electricity into hydrogen for storage and transportation, then reconverting it into electricity at the destination.
“Korea’s hydrogen supply and demand will stabilize by 2030, with 3.9 million tons used annually,” he added.
At the center of this vision is HTWO, HMG’s comprehensive hydrogen brand that encompasses the entire ecosystem from hydrogen production to transport, charging, and usage. Numerous Hyundai affiliates and group companies are expected to play critical roles throughout this process.
“We aim to make HTWO more than just a hydrogen brand,” Ramirez said. “It will become a hydrogen business platform that leads the hydrogen economy’s global expansion.”
