South Korean credit card companies are expanding their installment finance assets as their profitability deteriorates due to cuts in merchant fee rates.
According to sources from the financial industry on Tuesday, the combined volume of installment financing handled by the countryâ€™s six card companies that offer auto installment financing reached 2.65 trillion won ($1.9 billion) in the first half of 2025, up 8.2 percent from 2.45 trillion won a year earlier and up 60 percent from 1.66 trillion won two years ago.
The six card companies are Shinhan Card, Samsung Card, KB Kookmin Card, Lotte Card, Hana Card, and Woori Card.
The largest player was Shinhan Card, which handled 953.4 billion won in the first half alone, up 77.3 billion won from the same period a year ago.
KB Kookmin Card (799.2 billion won), Lotte Card (455 billion won), Hana Card (272.1 billion won), and Samsung Card (150.6 billion won) followed.
The main reason card companies are actively pushing these products is deteriorating profitability.
The preferential fee rates for merchants with annual sales under 3 billion won were cut by 0.05 to 0.1 percentage point this year, weakening their core business competitiveness.
Industry insiders noted that card companies are likely using auto installment finance as a way to offset shrinking fee revenues from merchants, rather than expecting profitability.
They are also encouraging customers to use card installment payments when purchasing cars.
Since card installment payments are technically treated as transactions rather than loans, they are not subject to the Debt Service Ratio (DSR) regulations.
Taking advantage of this, card companies offer higher commissions to intermediaries, who in turn recommend installment card payments to car buyers.
According to sources, card issuers are paying intermediaries commissions in the mid-to-high 1 percent range of the transaction amount, with some companies offering as much as 2.7 percent until July 2025.
While commission income goes to the intermediaries, card companies seek to benefit from installment interest revenue and the effect of acquiring new customers.
