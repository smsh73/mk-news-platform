SK gas Co. is seeking to raise at least 300 billion won ($220.6 million) by selling part of its stake in Ulsan GPS, according to investment banking industry sources on Tuesday.
The company is reportedly pushing to offload about 30 percent of its 99.48 percent stake in Ulsan GPS. Based on the power plant operator’s corporate value of around 1 trillion won, the deal is expected to secure a minimum of 300 billion won in fresh funding. Infrastructure funds are likely to show strong interest, as the sale involves the monetization of infrastructure assets such as power plants.
Ulsan GPS, built with a 1.4 trillion won investment by SK gas, is the world’s first gigawatt-scale gas combined cycle power plant capable of running on both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The facility has been pivotal in SK gas’s transition from an LPG-focused company to an LNG player.
With a generation capacity of 1.2 GW, Ulsan GPS can produce enough electricity annually to power about 2.8 million households.
